Rosemount 3051S Series

Rosemount 3051S Electronic Remote Sensors
The 3051S ERS™ System is a flexible, 2-wire 4-20 mA HART
architecture that calculates differential pressure (DP) electronically
using two pressure sensors that are linked together with a
non-proprietary electrical wire.
Ideal applications for the 3051S ERS System include tall vessels and
distillation columns that have traditionally required long lengths of
capillary or impulse piping. When used in these types of applications,
the 3051S ERS System can deliver:

1
Secondary

3051SAM

•

More accurate and repeatable DP measurements

•

Faster time response

•

Simplified installations

•

Reduced maintenance

How to Order
Coplanar

In-Line

1. Choose two ERS transmitter models. These may be any
combination of 3051SAM and 3051SAL models.

2

3051SAL

Primary
Coplanar
3

In-Line

3051SAL1PG4AA1A1020DFF71DA00M5
3051SAM1ST2A2E11A2A

2. Decide which model will be the ERS Primary (4-20 mA loop
termination and optional LCD) and which will be the ERS
Secondary. This will be specified by the “Configuration Type”
code in each model number.
3. Specify two full model numbers per the desired configuration.

Specifications
PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS

For zero-based spans, reference conditions, silicone oil fill, glass-filled PTFE o-rings, SST materials, Coplanar flange (3051SMV, 3051S_C) or
1/2 in.- 14 NPT (3051S_T) process connections, digital trim values set to equal range points.

Conformance to Specification (±3 (Sigma))
Technology leadership, advanced manufacturing techniques, and statistical process control ensure measurement specification conformance to
±3or better.

Reference Accuracy
Stated reference accuracy equations include terminal based linearity, hysteresis, and repeatability.
For FOUNDATION fieldbus and wireless devices, use calibrated range in place of span.

The Field Communicator requires a minimum

Advanced HART Diagnostics Suite
(Option Code DA2)
Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) provides statistical data
(standard deviation, mean, coefficient of variation) that can be
used to detect process and process equipment anomalies,
including plugged impulse lines, air entrainment, pump
cavitation, furnace flame instability, distillation column flooding
and more. This diagnostic allows you to take preventative
measures before abnormal process situations result in
unscheduled downtime or rework.
Power Advisory diagnostic proactively detects and notifies you
of degraded electrical loop integrity before it can affect your
process operation. Example loop problems that can be
detected include water in the terminal compartment, corrosion
of terminals, improper grounding, and unstable power
supplies.
The Device Dashboard presents the diagnostics in a
graphical, task-based interface that provides single click
access to critical process/device information and descriptive
graphical troubleshooting.
Suite includes: Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM), Power
Advisory, Status Log, Variable Log, Advanced Process Alerts,
Service Alerts, and Time Stamp capability.

Integrator Block
• Compares the integrated or accumulated value from one or
two variables to pre-trip and trip limits and generates
discrete output signals when the limits are reached. This
block is useful for calculating total flow, total mass, or
volume over time.
Output Splitter Block
• Splits the output of one PID or other control block so that the
PID will control two valves or other actuators.
Control Selector Block
• Selects one of up to three inputs (highest, middle, or lowest)
that are normally connected to the outputs of PID or other
control function blocks.

Fully Compensated Mass Flow Block (Option Code H01)
Calculates fully compensated mass flow based on differential
pressure with external process pressure and temperature
measurements over the fieldbus segment. Configuration for
the mass flow calculation is easily accomplished using the
Rosemount Engineering Assistant 5.5.1.
FOUNDATION fieldbus Diagnostics Suite
(Option Code D01)
Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) provides statistical data
(standard deviation and mean) that can be used to detect
process and process equipment anomalies, including plugged
impulse lines, air entrainment, pump cavitation, furnace flame
instability, distillation column flooding, and more. This
diagnostic allows you to take preventative measures before
abnormal process situations result in unscheduled downtime
or rework.
The Device Dashboard presents the diagnostics in a
graphical, task-based interface that provides single click
access to critical process/device information and descriptive
graphical troubleshooting.
Suite includes: Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) and
Plugged Impulse Line Detection (PIL).

(1) Process temperatures above 185 °F (85 °C) require derating the
ambient limits by a 1.5:1 ratio. For example, for process
temperature of 195 °F (91 °C), new ambient temperature limit is
equal to 170 °F (77 °C). This can be determined as follows:
(195 °F - 185 °F) x 1.5 = 15 °F,
185 °F - 15 °F = 170 °F
(2) 212 °F (100 °C) is the upper process temperature limit for DP
Range 0.
(3) 220 °F (104 °C) limit in vacuum service; 130 °F (54 °C) for
pressures below 0.5 psia.

Damping(1)
Analog output response time to a step change is user-selectable
from 0 to 60 seconds for one time constant. For 3051SMV,
3051SF_1-7, each variable can be individually adjusted. Software
damping is in addition to sensor module response time.
(1) Does not apply to wireless option code X.

Failure Mode Alarm
HART 4-20 mA (output option code A)
If self-diagnostics detect a gross transmitter failure, the analog
signal will be driven offscale to alert the user. Rosemount standard
(default), NAMUR, and custom alarm levels are available (see
Alarm Configuration below).
High or low alarm signal is software-selectable or
hardware-selectable via the optional switch (option D1).

Alarm Configuration

(4) -20 °F (-29 °C) is the lower process temperature limit with option
code P0.
(5) 32 °F (0 °C) is the lower process temperature limit for DP Range 0.
(6) For 3051S_C, 160 ° F (71 °C) limit in vacuum service.
For 3051SMV_ _ 1, 2, 140 ° F (60 °C) limit in vacuum service.
(7) Not available for 3051S_CA.
(8) Upper temperature limit is 464 °F (240 °C) for a 2-in. direct-mount
extension, 500 °F (260 °C) for a 4-in. direct-mount extension, and
599 °F (315 °C) for an In-Line Thermal Optimizer direct-mount
connection.

extension or greater.

recommendation NE 43, see option codes C4 or C5.
(2) Low alarm must be 0.1 mA less than low saturation and high
alarm must be 0.1 mA greater than high saturation.
(3) For 3051SMV and option code DA2, low alarm custom values
are 3.6 - 3.8 mA.
