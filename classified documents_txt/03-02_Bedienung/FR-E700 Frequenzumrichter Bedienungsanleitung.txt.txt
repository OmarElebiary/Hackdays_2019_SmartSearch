Electric Shock Prevention

P

WARNING:
● While power is on or when the inverter is running, do not open the front cover.
Otherwise you may get an electric shock.
● Do not run the inverter with the front cover removed. Otherwise, you may access
the exposed high-voltage terminals or the charging part of the circuitry and get an
electric shock.
● Even if power is off, do not remove the front cover except for wiring or periodic
inspection. You may access the charged inverter circuits and get an electric shock.
● Before starting wiring or inspection, check to make sure that the operation panel
indicator is off, wait for at least 10 minutes after the power supply has been switched
off, and check that there are no residual voltage using a tester or the like. The
capacitor is charged with high voltage for some time after power off and it is
dangerous.
● This inverter must be earthed. Earthing must conform to the requirements of
national and local safety regulations and electrical codes. (JIS, NEC section 250,
IEC 536 class 1 and other applicable standards)
Use a neutral-point earthed (grounded) power supply for 400V class inverter in
compliance with EN standard.
● Any person who is involved in the wiring or inspection of this equipment should
be fully competent to do the work.
● Always install the inverter before wiring. Otherwise, you may get an electric shock
or be injured.
● Perform setting dial and key operations with dry hands to prevent an electric shock.
Otherwise you may get an electric shock.
● Do not subject the cables to scratches, excessive stress, heavy loads or pinching.
Otherwise you may get an electric shock.
● Do not replace the cooling fan while power is on. It is dangerous to replace the
cooling fan while power is on.
● Do not touch the printed circuit board with wet hands. You may get an electric shock.
● When measuring the main circuit capacitor capacity, the DC voltage is applied to
the motor for 1s at powering off. Never touch the motor terminal, etc. right after
powering off to prevent an electric shock.

Fire Prevention

E

CAUTION:
● Mount the inverter to incombustible material. Install the inverter on a nonflammable
wall without holes (so that nobody can touch the inverter heatsink on the rear side,
etc.). Mounting it to or near combustible material can cause a fire.
● If the inverter has become faulty, switch off the inverter power. A continuous flow
of large current could cause a fire.
● When using a brake resistor, make up a sequence that will turn off power when an
alarm signal is output. Otherwise, the brake resistor may excessively overheat due
to damage of the brake transistor and such, causing a fire.
● Do not connect a resistor directly to the DC terminals +, –. This could cause a fire
and destroy the inverter. The surface temperature of braking resistors can far
exceed 100°C for brief periods. Make sure that there is adequate protection against
accidental contact and a safe distance is maintained to other units and system
parts.

Injury Prevention

E

CAUTION:
● Apply only the voltage specified in the instruction manual to each terminal. Otherwise, burst, damage, etc. may occur.
● Ensure that the cables are connected to the correct terminals. Otherwise, burst,
damage, etc. may occur.
● Always make sure that polarity is correct to prevent damage, etc. Otherwise, burst,
damage, etc. may occur.
● While power is on or for some time after power-off, do not touch the inverter as it
is hot and you may get burnt.

Transport und Installation

E

CAUTION:
● Transport the product using the correct method that corresponds to the weight.
Failure to observe this could lead to injuries.
● Do not stack the inverter boxes higher than the number recommended.
● Ensure that installation position and material can withstand the weight of the
inverter. Install according to the information in the instruction manual.
● Do not install or operate the inverter if it is damaged or has parts missing. This can
result in breakdowns.
● When carrying the inverter, do not hold it by the front cover or setting dial; it may
fall off or fail.
● Do not stand or rest heavy objects on the product.
● Check the inverter mounting orientation is correct.
● Prevent other conductive bodies such as screws and metal fragments or other
flammable substance such as oil from entering the inverter.
● As the inverter is a precision instrument, do not drop or subject it to impact.
● Use the inverter under the following environmental conditions. Otherwise, the
inverter may be damaged.

IV

CAUTION:
● Do not install assemblies or components (e. g. power factor correction capacitors)
on the inverter output side, which are not approved from Mitsubishi.
● The direction of rotation of the motor corresponds to the direction of rotation
commands (STF/STR) only if the phase sequence (U, V, W) is maintained.

Trial run

E

CAUTION:
● Before starting operation, confirm and adjust the parameters. A failure to do so
may cause some machines to make unexpected motions.

Operation

P

WARNING:
● When you have chosen the retry function, stay away from the equipment as it will
restart suddenly after an alarm stop.
● Since pressing the STOP/RESET-key may not stop output depending on the function setting status, provide a circuit and switch separately to make an emergency
stop (power off, mechanical brake operation for emergency stop, etc).
● Make sure that the start signal is off before resetting the inverter alarm. A failure
to do so may restart the motor suddenly.
● The load used should be a three-phase induction motor only. Connection of any
other electrical equipment to the inverter output may damage the equipment.
● Do not modify the equipment.
● Do not perform parts removal which is not instructed in this manual. Doing so may
lead to fault or damage of the inverter.

E

CAUTION:
● The electronic thermal relay function does not guarantee protection of the motor
from overheating. It is recommended to install both an external thermal and PTC
thermistor for overheat protection.
● Do not use a magnetic contactor on the inverter input for frequent starting/stopping
of the inverter. Otherwise, the life of the inverter decreases.
● Use a noise filter to reduce the effect of electromagnetic interference and follow
the accepted EMC procedures for proper installation of frequency inverters. Otherwise nearby electronic equipment may be affected.
● Take appropriate measures regarding harmonics. Otherwise this can endanger
compensation systems or overload generators.
● Use a motor designed for inverter operation. (The stress for motor windings is
bigger than in line power supply).
● When parameter clear or all clear is performed, set again the required parameters
before starting operations. Each parameter returns to the initial value.
● The inverter can be easily set for high-speed operation. Before changing its setting,
fully examine the performances of the motor and machine.
● The DC braking function of the frequency inverter is not designed to continuously
hold a load. Use an electro-mechanical holding brake on the motor for this purpose.
● Before running an inverter which had been stored for a long period, always perform
inspection and test operation.
● For prevention of damage due to static electricity, touch nearby metal before
touching this product to eliminate static electricity from your body.

Emergency stop

E

CAUTION:
● Provide a safety backup such as an emergency brake which will prevent the
machine and equipment from hazardous conditions if the inverter fails.
● When the breaker on the inverter primary side trips, check for the wiring fault (short
circuit), damage to internal parts of the inverter, etc. Identify the cause of the trip,
then remove the cause and power on the breaker.
● When the protective function is activated (i. e. the frequency inverter switches off
with an error message), take the corresponding corrective action as described in
the inverter manual, then reset the inverter, and resume operation.

Maintenance, inspection and parts replacement

E

CAUTION:
● Do not carry out a megger (insulation resistance) test on the control circuit of the
inverter. It will cause a failure.

Disposing the inverter

E

CAUTION:
● Treat as industrial waste.

General instructions

Enclosure design

Enclosure design
When an inverter enclosure is to be designed and manufactured, heat generated by contained
equipment, etc., the environment of an operating place, and others must be fully considered to
determine the enclosure structure, size and equipment layout. The inverter unit uses many
semiconductor devices. To ensure higher reliability and long period of operation, operate the inverter in the ambient environment that completely satisfies the equipment specifications.

2.4.1

Inverter installation environment
As the inverter installation environment should satisfy the standard specifications indicated in
the following table, operation in any place that does not meet these conditions not only deteriorates the performance and life of the inverter, but also causes a failure. Refer to the following
points and take adequate measures.

Tab. 2-1: Environmental standard specifications of inverter
Temperature
The permissible ambient temperature of the inverter FR-E700 is between −10 and +50°C. Always operate the inverter within this temperature range. Operation outside this range will considerably shorten the service lives of the semiconductors, parts, capacitors and others. Take the
following measures so that the ambient temperature of the inverter falls within the specified
range.
● Measures against high temperature
– Use a forced ventilation system or similar cooling system. (Refer to page 2-10.)
– Install the enclosure in an air-conditioned electrical chamber.
– Block direct sunlight.
– Provide a shield or similar plate to avoid direct exposure to the radiated heat and wind
of a heat source.
– Ventilate the area around the enclosure well.
● Measures against low temperature
– Provide a space heater in the enclosure.
– Do not power off the inverter. (Keep the start signal of the inverter off.)
● Sudden temperature changes
– Select an installation place where temperature does not change suddenly.
– Avoid installing the inverter near the air outlet of an air conditioner.
– If temperature changes are caused by opening/closing of a door, install the inverter away
from the door.

FR-E700 EC

2-7

Enclosure design

Installation

Humidity
Normally operate the inverter within the 45% to 90% range of the ambient humidity. Too high humidity will pose problems of reduced insulation and metal corrosion. On the other hand, too low
humidity may produce a spatial electrical breakdown. The insulation distance specified in
JEM1103 "Control Equipment Insulator" is defined as humidity 45% to 85%.
● Measures against high humidity
– Make the enclosure enclosed, and provide it with a hygroscopic agent.
– Take dry air into the enclosure from outside.
– Provide a space heater in the enclosure
● Measures against low humidity
What is important in fitting or inspection of the unit in this status is to discharge your body
(static electricity) beforehand and keep your body from contact with the parts and patterns,
besides blowing air of proper humidity into the enclosure from outside.
● Measures against condensation
Condensation may occur if frequent operation stops change the in-enclosure temperature
suddenly or if the outside air temperature changes suddenly. Condensation causes such
faults as reduced insulation and corrosion.
– Take the measures against high humidity.
– Do not power off the inverter. (Keep the start signal of the inverter off.)
Dust, dirt, oil mist
Dust and dirt will cause such faults as poor contact of contact points, reduced insulation or reduced cooling effect due to moisture absorption of accumulated dust and dirt, and in-enclosure
temperature rise due to clogged filter.
In the atmosphere where conductive powder floats, dust and dirt will cause such faults as malfunction, deteriorated insulation and short circuit in a short time.
Since oil mist will cause similar conditions, it is necessary to take adequate measures.
● Measures against dust, dirt, oil mist
– Place in a totally enclosed enclosure.
Take measures if the in-enclosure temperature rises. (Refer to page 2-10.)
– Purge air.
Pump clean air from outside to make the in-enclosure pressure higher than the outsideair pressure.
Corrosive gas, salt damage
If the inverter is exposed to corrosive gas or to salt near a beach, the printed board patterns and
parts will corrode or the relays and switches will result in poor contact. In such places, take the
measures against dust, dirt, oil mist.

2-8

Installation

Enclosure design
Explosive, flammable gases
As the inverter is non-explosion proof, it must be contained in an explosion proof enclosure.
In places where explosion may be caused by explosive gas, dust or dirt, an enclosure cannot be
used unless it structurally complies with the guidelines and has passed the specified tests. This
makes the enclosure itself expensive (including the test charges).
The best way is to avoid installation in such places and install the inverter in a non-hazardous
place.
Highland
Use the inverter at the altitude of within 1000m.
If it is used at a higher place, it is likely that thin air will reduce the cooling effect and low air pressure will deteriorate dielectric strength.
Vibration, impact
The vibration resistance of the inverter is up to 5.9m/s² at 10 to 55Hz frequency and 1mm amplitude for the directions of X, Y, Z axes.
Vibration or impact, if less than the specified value, applied for a long time may make the mechanism loose or cause poor contact to the connectors.
Especially when impact is imposed repeatedly, caution must be taken as the part pins are likely
to break.
● Countermeasures
– Provide the enclosure with rubber vibration isolators.
– Strengthen the structure to prevent the enclosure from resonance.
– Install the enclosure away from sources of vibration.

Cooling system types for inverter enclosure
From the enclosure that contains the inverter, the heat of the inverter and other equipment
(transformers, lamps, resistors, etc.) and the incoming heat such as direct sunlight must be dissipated to keep the in-enclosure temperature lower than the permissible temperatures of the inenclosure equipment including the inverter.
The cooling systems are classified as follows in terms of the cooling calculation method.
● Cooling by natural heat dissipation from the enclosure surface (Totally enclosed type)
● Cooling by heat sink (Aluminium fin, etc.)
● Cooling by ventilation (Forced ventilation type, pipe ventilation type)
● Cooling by heat exchanger or cooler (Heat pipe, cooler, etc.)

Arrangement of multiple inverters
When multiple inverters are placed in the same enclosure, generally arrange them horizontally

NOTE

When mounting multiple inverters, fully take caution not to make the ambient temperature of
the inverter higher than the permissible value by providing ventilation and increasing the
enclosure size.

Placement of ventilation fan and inverter
Heat generated in the inverter is blown up from the bottom of the unit as warm air by the cooling
fan. When installing a ventilation fan for that heat, determine the place of ventilation fan installation after fully considering an air flow. (Air passes through areas of low resistance. Make an airway and airflow plates to expose the inverter to cool air.)

NOTES

Wiring

Do not install a power factor correction capacitor or surge suppressor on the inverter output
side. This will cause the inverter to trip or the capacitor and surge suppressor to be damaged. If any of the above devices are connected, immediately remove them.
Electromagnetic Compatibility
Operation of the frequency inverter can cause electromagnetic interference in the input and
output that can be propagated by cable (via the power input lines), by wireless radiation to
nearby equipment (e.g. AM radios) or via data and signal lines.
Activate the integrated EMC filter (and an additional optional filter if present) to reduce air
propagated interference on the input side of the inverter. Use AC or DC reactors to reduce
line propagated noise (harmonics). Use shielded motor power lines to reduce output noise
(refer also to section 3.8 Electromagnetic Compatibility).

The recommended cable size is that of the HIV cable (600 V class 2 vinyl-insulated cable)
with continuous maximum permissible temperature of 75 °C. Assumes that the ambient
temperature is 50 °C or less and the wiring distance is 20 m or less.

The recommended cable size is that of the THHW cable with continuous maximum
permissible temperature of 75 °C. Assumes that the ambient temperature is 40 °C or less
and the wiring distance is 20 m or less.
(Selection example for use mainly in the United States.)
 The recommended cable size is that of the PVC cable with continuous maximum permissible
temperature of 70°C. Assumes that the ambient temperature is 40°C or less and the wiring
distance is 20m or less.
(Selection example for use mainly in Europe.)

The terminal screw size indicates the terminal size for R/L1, S/L2, T/L3, U, V, W, and a screw
for earthing. (For single-phase power input, the terminal screw size indicates the size of
terminal screw for L1, N, U, V, W, PR, +, – and P1 and a screw for earthing (grounding).)
The line voltage drop can be calculated by the following expression:
3 × wire restistance [mΩ/m ] × wiring distance [m] × current [A]Line voltage drop [V] = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1000
Use a larger diameter cable when the wiring distance is long or when it is desired to decrease
the voltage drop (torque reduction) in the low speed range.

Notes on earthing

P

CAUTION:
Leakage currents flow in the inverter or the EMC filter respectively. To prevent an
electric shock, the inverter, input filter and motor must be earthed. (This inverter must
be earthed. Earthing must conform to the requirements of national and local safety
regulations and electrical codes. (JIS, NEC section 250, IEC 536 class 1 and other
applicable standards)).
Use the dedicated earth terminal to earth the inverter. (Do not use the screw in the casing, chassis, etc.)
Use the thickest possible earth cable. Use the cable whose size is equal to or greater than that
indicated in Tab. 3-6, and minimize the cable length. The earthing point should be as near as
possible to the inverter.
Always earth the motor and inverter
● Purpose of earthing
Generally, an electrical apparatus has an earth terminal, which must be connected to the
ground before use.
An electrical circuit is usually insulated by an insulating material and encased. However, it
is impossible to manufacture an insulating material that can shut off a leakage current
completely, and actually, a slight current flow into the case. The purpose of earthing the case
of an electrical apparatus is to prevent operator from getting an electric shock from this
leakage current when touching it.
To avoid the influence of external noises, this earthing is important to audio equipment,
sensors, computers and other apparatuses that handle low-level signals or operate very fast.
● Earthing methods and earthing work
As described previously, earthing is roughly classified into an electrical shock prevention
type and a noise affected malfunction prevention type. Therefore, these two types should
be discriminated clearly, and the following work must be done to prevent the leakage current
having the inverter's high frequency components from entering the malfunction prevention
type earthing:
– Where possible, use independent earthing for the inverter. If independent earthing (I) is
impossible, use joint earthing (II) where the inverter is connected with the other equipment at an earthing point. Joint earthing as in (III) must be avoided as the inverter is
connected with the other equipment by a common earth cable.
Also a leakage current including many high frequency components flows in the earth
cables of the inverter and inverter-driven motor. Therefore, they must use the independent earthing method and be separated from the earthing of equipment sensitive to the
aforementioned noises.
In a tall building, it will be a good policy to use the noise malfunction prevention type
earthing with steel frames and carry out electric shock prevention type earthing in the
independent earthing method.
– This inverter must be earthed. Earthing must conform to the requirements of national
and local safety regulations and electrical codes. (JIS, NEC section 250, IEC 536 class
1 and other applicable standards).
– Use the thickest possible earth cable. The earth cable should be of not less than the size
indicated in Tab. 3-6.
– The grounding point should be as near as possible to the inverter, and the ground wire
length should be as short as possible.
– Run the earth cable as far away as possible from the I/O wiring of equipment sensitive
to noises and run them in parallel in the minimum distance.

NOTES

Main circuit connection

Note that the motor windings are subjected to significantly higher loads when the motor is
operated by inverter than with normal mains operation. The motors must be approved for
inverter operation by the manufacturer (refer also to section 3.8.4).
Especially for long-distance wiring, the inverter may be affected by a charging current
caused by the stray capacitances of the wiring, leading to a malfunction of the overcurrent
protective function, fast response current limit function, or stall prevention function or a malfunction or fault of the equipment connected on the inverter output side.
If fast-response current limit malfunctions, disable this function. When the stall prevention
function misoperates, increase the stall level. (Refer Pr. 22 "Stall prevention operation level"
and Pr. 156 "Stall prevention operation selection".)
Refer to section 6.15.1 for details of Pr. 72 "PWM frequency selection".
When using the automatic restart after instantaneous power failure function with wiring
length exceeding than 100m, select without frequency search (Pr. 162 = "1, 11").

Common terminals of the control circuits PC, 5, SE
Terminals PC, 5, and SE are all common terminals (0V) for I/O signals and are isolated from
each other. Avoid connecting the terminal PC and 5 and the terminal SE and 5. Terminal PC is
a common terminal for the contact input terminals (STF, STR, RH, RM, RL, MRS and RES).
The open collector circuit is isolated from the internal control circuit by photocoupler.
Terminal 5 is a common terminal for frequency setting signal (terminal 2 or 4) and analog output
terminal AM. It should be protected from external noise using a shielded or twisted cable.
Terminal SE is a common terminal for the open collector output terminal RUN and FU.
The contact input circuit is isolated from the internal control circuit by photocoupler.
Signal inputs by contactless switch
The contacted input terminals of the inverter (STF, STR, RH, RM, RL, MRS and RES) can be
controlled using a transistor instead of a contacted switch as shown below. According to the adjusted control logic, PNP transistors (positive logic) or NPN transistors (negative logic) must be
used to activate the inputs.

FR-E700 frequency inverters offer the possibility of choosing between two types of control logic.
Depending on the direction of the flowing current, one distinguishes between:
● In sink logic, a signal switches on when a current flows from the corresponding signal input
terminal. Terminal SD is common to the contact input signals. Terminal SE is common to
the open collector output signals.
● In source logic, a signal switches on when a current flows into the corresponding signal input
terminal. Terminal PC is common to the contact input signals. Terminal SE is common to

On the inverter input side, it is recommended to provide an MC for the following purposes.
● To release the inverter from the power supply when the fault occurs or when the drive is not
functioning (e.g. emergency stop operation).
When cycle operation or heavy-duty operation is performed with an optional brake resistor
connected, overheat and burnout of the discharging resistor can be prevented if a regenerative brake transistor is damaged due to insufficient heat capacity of the discharging resistor
and excess regenerative brake duty.
● To prevent any accident due to an automatic restart at restoration of power after an inverter
stop made by a power failure.
● The control power supply for inverter is always running and consumes a little power. When
stopping the inverter for an extended period of time, powering off the inverter will save power
slightly.
● To separate the inverter from the power supply to ensure safe maintenance and inspection
work.

NOTE

3 - 26

Since repeated inrush currents at power on will shorten the life of the converter circuit
(switching life is about 1,000,000 times.), frequent starts and stops of the MC must be
avoided. Turn on/off the inverter start controlling terminals (STF, STR) to run/stop the
inverter.

Handling of the inverter output side magnetic contactor
Switch the magnetic contactor between the inverter and motor only when both the inverter and
motor are at a stop. When the magnetic contactor is turned on while the inverter is operating,
overcurrent protection of the inverter and such will activate. When an MC is provided for switching to the commercial power supply, for example, switch it on/off after the inverter and motor
have stopped.

3.8.1

Leakage currents and countermeasures

Wiring

Mains filters, shielded motor cables, the motor, and the inverter itself cause stationary and variable leakage currents to PE. Since its value depends on the capacitances, carrier frequency,
etc., low acoustic noise operation at the increased carrier frequency of the inverter will increase
the leakage current. Therefore, take the following measures. Select the earth leakage breaker
according to its rated sensitivity current, independently of the carrier frequency setting.
To-earth (ground) leakage currents
Leakage currents may flow not only into the inverter's own line but also into the other lines
through the earth (ground) cable, etc. These leakage currents may operate earth (ground) leakage circuit breakers and earth leakage relays unnecessarily.
● Countermeasures
– If the carrier frequency setting is high, decrease the Pr. 72 "PWM frequency selection"
setting. Note that motor noise increases. Selecting Pr. 240 "Soft-PWM operation selection" makes the sound inoffensive.
– By using earth leakage circuit breakers designed for harmonic and surge suppression
in the inverter's own line and other line, operation can be performed with the carrier
frequency kept high (with low noise).
● To-earth leakage currents
– Take caution as long wiring will increase the leakage current. Decreasing the carrier
frequency of the inverter reduces the leakage current.
– Increasing the motor capacity increases the leakage current.
– Shielded motor cables significantly increase the leakage current to PE (approx. double
the value generated with unshielded motor cables of the same length).
– The leakage current of the 400V class is larger than that of the 200V class.
Line-to-line leakage currents
Harmonics of leakage currents flowing in static capacities between the inverter output cables
may operate the external thermal relay unnecessarily. When the wiring length is long (50m or
more) for the 400V class small-capacity model (FR-E700-170 or less), the external thermal relay
is likely to operate unnecessarily because the ratio of the leakage current to the rated motor
current increases.

● Countermeasures
– Use Pr. 9 "Electronic thermal O/L relay".
– If the carrier frequency setting is high, decrease the Pr. 72 "PWM frequency selection"
setting. Note that motor noise increases. Selecting Pr. 240 "Soft-PWM operation selection" makes the sound inoffensive. To ensure that the motor is protected against line-toline leakage currents, it is recommended to use a temperature sensor (e.g. PTC element)
to directly detect motor temperature.
● Selecting a power supply circuit breaker:
You can also use a circuit breaker (MCCB) to protect the power supply lines against short
circuits and overloads. However, note that this does not protect the inverter (rectifiers, IGBT).
Select the capacity of the circuit breaker on the basis of the cross-sectional area of the power
supply lines. To calculate the required mains current trip point you need to know the power
required by the inverter (Refer to Rated Input Capacity in Appendix A, Specifications) and
the mains supply voltage. Select a circuit breaker with a trip point that is slightly higher than
calculated, particularly in the case of breakers with electromagnetic tripping, since the trip
characteristics are strongly influenced by the harmonics in the power supply line.

NOTE

FR-E700 EC

The earth leakage breaker must be either a Mitsubishi earth leakage breaker (ELB, for harmonics and surges) or an ELB with breaker designed for harmonic and surge suppression
that is approved for use with frequency inverters.

3 - 39

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)

Wiring

Note on selecting a suitable power supply ELCB
If you install a Mitsubishi frequency inverter with a 3-phase power supply in locations where an
earth leakage contact breaker is required by the VDE you must install a universal-current sensitive ELCB conforming to the specifications laid down in VDE 0160 / EN 50178 (ELCB Type B).
This is necessary because pulse-current sensitive ELCBs (Type A) do not pro-vide reliable tripping performance for the frequency inverter in response to DC leakage current.
When selecting a suitable universal-current sensitive ELCB you must also take into account the
influence of the mains filter, the length of the shielded motor power cables and the frequency on
the leakage currents.
Also note that when the mains power is switched on with switches without a snap-action function
the resulting brief asymmetrical load can cause unwanted triggering of the ELCB.
This problem can be avoided by using a Type B ELCB with a delayed response function, or by
using a contactor relay to switch all three phases simultaneously.
Calculate the trip current sensitivity of the ELB as follows:
● Breaker designed for harmonic and surge suppression:
IΔn ≥ 10 × (Ig1 + Ign + Igi + lg2 + lgm)
● Standard breaker:
IΔn ≥ 10 × [Ig1 + Ign + Igi + 3 × (Ig2 + lgm)]

NOTES

The frequency inverter monitors its own output for ground faults up to a frequency of 120Hz.
However, it is important to understand that this feature only protects the inverter itself. It cannot be used to provide protection against shock hazards for personnel.
In the connection earthed-neutral system, the sensitivity current is purified against an earth
fault in the inverter output side. Earthing must conform to the requirements of national and
local safety regulations and electrical codes. (JIS, NEC section 250, IEC 536 class 1 and
other applicable standards)
When the breaker is installed on the output side of the inverter, it may be unnecessarily
operated by harmonics even if the effective value is less than the rating. In this case, do not
install the breaker since the eddy current and hysteresis loss will increase, leading to temperature rise.
The following models are standard breakers: BV-C1, BC-V, NVB, NV-L, NV-G2N, NV-G3NA
and NV-2F earth leakage relay (except NV-ZHA), NV with AA neutral wire open-phase protection.

Inverter-generated noises and their reduction techniques
Some noises enter the inverter to malfunction it and others are radiated by the inverter to malfunction peripheral devices. Though the inverter is designed to be insusceptible to noises, it handles low-level signals, so it requires the following basic techniques. Also, since the inverter
chops outputs at high carrier frequency, that could generate noises. If these noises cause peripheral devices to malfunction, measures should be taken to suppress noises.
These techniques differ slightly depending on noise propagation paths.
● Basic techniques
– Do not run the power cables (I/O cables) and signal cables of the inverter in parallel with
each other and do not bundle them.
– Use twisted pair shielded cables for the detector connection and control signal cables.
Earth the shield.
– Earth the inverter, motor, etc. at one point.
● Techniques to reduce noises that enter and malfunction the inverter
When devices that generate many noises (which use magnetic contactors, magnetic brakes,
many relays, for example) are installed near the inverter and the inverter may be malfunctioned by noises, the following measures must be taken:
– Provide surge suppressors for devices that generate many noises to suppress noises.
– Fit data line filters to signal cables.
– Earth the shields of the detector connection and control signal cables with cable clamp
metal.
● Techniques to reduce noises that are radiated by the inverter to malfunction peripheral
devices
Inverter-generated noises are largely classified into:
– those radiated by the cables connected to the inverter and inverter main circuits (I/O),
– those electromagnetically and electrostatically induced to the signal cables of the
peripheral devices close to the main circuit power supply,
– and those transmitted through the power supply cables.

When devices that handle low-level signals and are liable to malfunction due to noises, e.g.
instruments, receivers and sensors, are contained in the enclosure that contains the inverter
or when their signal cables are run near the inverter, the devices may be malfunctioned by airpropagated noises. The following measures must be taken:

 Install easily affected devices as far away as possible from the inverter.
 Run easily affected signal cables as far away as possible from the inverter and its I/O
cables.

 Do not run the signal cables and power cables (inverter I/O cables) in parallel with each
other and do not bundle them.

 Inserting a filter (dU/dt, sine wave filter) into the output suppresses the radiation noise from
the cables.

 Use shield cables as signal cables and power cables and run them in individual metal
conduits to produce further effects.



When the signal cables are run in parallel with or bundled with the power cables, magnetic and
static induction noises may be propagated to the signal cables to malfunction the devices and
the following measures must be taken:

 Install easily affected devices as far away as possible from the inverter.
 Run easily affected signal cables as far away as possible from the I/O cables of the inverter.
 Do not run the signal cables and power cables (inverter I/O cables) in parallel with each
other and do not bundle them.

 Use shield cables as signal cables and power cables and run them in individual metal
conduits to produce further effects.

When the power supplies of the peripheral devices are connected to the power supply of the
inverter in the same line, inverter-generated noises may flow back through the power supply
cables to malfunction the devices and the following measures must be taken:

 Use additional (optional) noise filters as required.
 Install output filters to the power cables of the inverter after you consulted MITSUBISHI.
When a closed loop circuit is formed by connecting the peripheral device wiring to the inverter,
leakage currents may flow through the earth cable of the inverter to malfunction the device. In
such a case, disconnection of the earth cable of the device may cause the device to operate
properly.

Wiring

Inverter-driven 400V class motor
In the PWM type inverter, a surge voltage attributable to wiring constants is generated at the motor terminals. Especially for a 400V class motor, the surge voltage may deteriorate the insulation. When the 400V class motor is driven by the inverter, consider the following measures:
● Rectifying the motor insulation and limiting the PWM carrier frequency according to the
wiring length. For the 400V class motor, use an insulation-enhanced motor.
– Specify the "400V class inverter-driven insulation-enhanced motor".
– For the dedicated motor such as the constant-torque motor and low-vibration motor, use
the "inverter-driven, dedicated motor".
– Set Pr. 72 "PWM frequency selection" as indicated below according to the wiring length.

Tab. 3-21: Setting of Pr. 72 according to the wiring length
● Limiting the voltage rise speed of the frequency inverter output voltage (dU/dT):
If the motor requires a rise speed of 500V/µs or less you must install a filter in the output of
the inverter. Please contact your Mitsubishi dealer for more details.

Operation

4.1

Precautions for use of the inverter
The FR-E700 series is a highly reliable product, but incorrect peripheral circuit making or operation/handling method may shorten the product life or damage the product.
Before starting operation, always recheck the following items.
● Use crimping terminals with insulation sleeve to wire the power supply and motor.
● Application of power to the output terminals (U, V, W) of the inverter will damage the inverter.
Never perform such wiring.
● After wiring, wire offcuts must not be left in the inverter.
Wire offcuts can cause an alarm, failure or malfunction. Always keep the inverter clean.
When drilling mounting holes in a control box etc., take care not to allow chips and other
foreign matter to enter the inverter.
● Use cables of the size to make a voltage drop 2% maximum.
If the wiring distance is long between the inverter and motor, a main circuit cable voltage
drop will cause the motor torque to decrease especially at the output of a low frequency.
(Refer to page 3-9 for the recommended cable sizes.)
● The overall wiring length should be 500m maximum.
Especially for long distance wiring, the fast-response current limit function may be reduced
or the equipment connected to the inverter output side may malfunction or become faulty
under the influence of a charging current due to the stray capacity of the wiring. Therefore,
note the overall wiring length. (Refer to page 3-12.)
● Electromagnetic Compatibility
Operation of the frequency inverter can cause electromagnetic interference in the input and
output that can be propagated by cable (via the power input lines), by wireless radiation to
nearby equipment (e.g. AM radios) or via data and signal lines.
Use AC or DC reactors to reduce line propagated noise (harmonics). Use shielded motor
power lines to reduce output noise (refer also to section 3.8 Electromagnetic Compatibility).
● Do not install a power factor correction capacitor, surge suppressor or radio noise filter on
the inverter output side. This will cause the inverter to trip or the capacitor and surge
suppressor to be damaged. If any of the above devices is installed, immediately remove it.
● Before starting wiring or other work after the inverter is operated, wait for at least 10 minutes
after the power supply has been switched off, and check that there are no residual voltage
using a tester or the like. The capacitor is charged with high voltage for some time after
power off and it is dangerous.
● A short circuit or earth fault on the inverter output side may damage the inverter modules.
– Fully check the insulation resistance of the circuit prior to inverter operation since
repeated short circuits caused by peripheral circuit inadequacy or an earth fault caused
by wiring inadequacy or reduced motor insulation resistance may damage the inverter
modules.
– Fully check the to-earth insulation and inter-phase insulation of the inverter output side
before power-on.
Especially for an old motor or use in hostile atmosphere, securely check the motor
insulation resistance etc.

Precautions for use of the inverter

Operation

● Do not use the inverter input side magnetic contactor to start/stop the inverter.
Always use the start signal (ON/OFF of STF and STR signals) to start/stop the inverter.
● Across + and PR terminals, connect only an external regenerative brake discharging resistor.
Do not connect a mechanical brake.
The brake resistor can not be connected to the FR-E720S-008 and 015. Leave terminals +
and PR open. Also, never short between + and PR.
● Do not apply a voltage higher than the permissible voltage to the inverter I/O signal circuits.
Contact to the inverter I/O signal circuits or opposite polarity may damage the I/O devices.
Especially check the wiring to prevent the speed setting potentiometer from being connected
incorrectly to short terminals 10-5.
● Provide electrical and mechanical interlocks for MC1 and MC2 which are used for commercial power supply-inverterswitch-over.
When the wiring is incorrect or if there is a commercial power supply-inverter switch-over
circuit as shown below, the inverter will be damaged by leakage current from the power
supply due to arcs generated at the time of switch-over or chattering caused by a sequence
error.

CAUTION:
If the machine must not be restarted when power is restored after a power failure,
provide a magnetic contactor in the inverter's input side and also make up a sequence
which will not switch on the start signal.
If the start signal (start switch) remains on after a power failure, the inverter will
automatically restart as soon as the power is restored.
● Instructions for overload operation
When performing operation of frequent start/stop of the inverter, increase/decrease in the
temperature of the transistor element of the inverter may repeat due to a continuous flow of
large current, shortening the life from thermal fatigue. Since thermal fatigue is related to the
amount of current, the life can be increased by reducing bound current, starting current, etc.
Decreasing current may increase the life. However, decreasing current will result in insufficient torque and the inverter may not start. Therefore, increase the inverter capacity to have
enough allowance for current.
● Make sure that the specifications and rating match the system requirements.
● When the motor speed is unstable, due to change in the frequency setting signal caused by
electromagnetic noises from the inverter, take the following measures when applying the
motor speed by the analog signal.
– Do not run the signal cables and power cables (inverter I/O cables) in parallel with each
other and do not bundle them.
– Run signal cables as far away as possible from power cables (inverter I/O cables).
– Use shield cables as signal cables.
– Install a ferrite core on the signal cable (Example: ZCAT3035-1330 TDK).

Precautions for use of the inverter

Failsafe of the system which uses the inverter
When a fault occurs, the inverter trips to output a fault signal. However, a fault output signal may
not be output at an inverter fault occurrence when the detection circuit or output circuit fails, etc.
Although Mitsubishi assures best quality products, provide an interlock which uses inverter status output signals to prevent accidents such as damage to machine when the inverter fails for
some reason and at the same time consider the system configuration where failsafe from outside the inverter, without using the inverter, is enabled even if the inverter fails.
Interlock method which uses the inverter status output signals
By combining the inverter status output signals to provide an interlock as shown below, an inverter alarm can be detected.

Operation

Checking the inverter operating status by the inverter operation ready completion signal
Operation ready signal (RY signal) is output when the inverter power is on and the inverter becomes operative. Check if the RY signal is output after powering on the inverter.
Checking the inverter operating status by the start signal input to the inverter and
inverter running signal
The inverter running signal (RUN signal) is output when the inverter is running (RUN signal is assigned to terminal RUN in the initial setting).
Check if RUN signal is output when inputting the start signal to the inverter (forward signal is STF
signal and reverse signal is STR signal). For logic check, note that RUN signal is output for the
period from the inverter decelerates until output to the motor is stopped, configure a sequence
considering the inverter deceleration time.

Checking the motor operating status by the start signal input to the inverter and inverter
output current detection signal
The output current detection signal (Y12 signal) is output when the inverter operates and currents flows in the motor. Check if Y12 signal is output when inputting the start signal to the inverter (forward signal is STF signal and reverse signal is STR signal).
Note that the current level at which Y12 signal is output is set to 150% of the inverter rated current in the initial setting, it is necessary to adjust the level to around 20% using no load current
of the motor as reference with Pr. 150 "Output current detection level".
For logic check, as same as the inverter running signal (RUN signal), the inverter outputs for the
period from the inverter decelerates until output to the motor is stopped, configure a sequence
considering the inverter deceleration time.

Backup method outside the inverter
Even if the interlock is provided by the inverter status signal, enough failsafe is not ensured depending on the failure status of the inverter itself. For example, even if the interlock is provided
using the inverter fault output signal, start signal and RUN signal output, there is a case where
a fault output signal is not output and RUN signal is kept output even if an inverter fault occurs.
Provide a speed detector to detect the motor speed and current detector to detect the motor current and consider the backup system such as checking up as below according to the level of importance of the system.
● Start signal and actual operation check
Check the motor running and motor current while the start signal is input to the inverter by
comparing the start signal to the inverter and detected speed of the speed detector or
detected current of the current detector. Note that the motor current runs as the motor is
running for the period until the motor stops since the inverter starts decelerating even if the
start signal turns off. For the logic check, configure a sequence considering the inverter
deceleration time. In addition, it is recommended to check the three-phase current when
using the current detector.
● Command speed and actual operation check
Check if there is no gap between the actual speed and commanded speed by comparing
the inverter speed command and detected speed of the speed detector.

Protective function by electronic thermal relay function is reset by inverter power reset and

When two or more motors are connected to the inverter, they cannot be protected by the
electronic thermal relay function. Install an external thermal relay to each motor.
When the difference between the inverter and motor capacities is large and the setting is
small, the protective characteristics of the electronic over current protection will be deteriorated. In this case, use an external thermal relay.
A special motor cannot be protected by the electronic thermal relay function. Use an external thermal relay.

To exhibit the best performance of the motor performance
(offline auto tuning) (Pr. 9, Pr. 71, Pr. 83, Pr. 84, Pr. 96)
The motor performance can be maximized with offline auto tuning.
What is offline auto tuning?
When performing advanced magnetic flux vector control or general-purpose magnetic flux vector control, the motor can be run with the optimum operating characteristics by automatically
measuring the motor constants (offline auto tuning) even when each motor constants differs,
other manufacturer's motor is used, or the wiring length is long.

Description

Set the rated motor current.
By selecting a standard motor or constant-torque motor,
thermal characteristic and motor constants of each
motor are set.

Refer to appendix A for the rated inverter output current.
The initial value differs according to the voltage class: 200V/400V

This function is made valid only when a value other than "9999" is set in Pr. 80 and Pr. 81
and advanced magnetic flux vector control or general-purpose magnetic flux vector control is
selected.)
You can copy the offline auto tuning data (motor constants) to another inverter with the PU
(FR-PU07).
Even when motors (other manufacturer's motor, SF-JRC, etc.) other than Mitsubishi standard motor, high efficiency motor (SF-JR, SF-HR 0.2kW or more), and Mitsubishi constanttorque motor (SF-JRCA four-pole, SF-HRCA 0.4kW to 15kW) are used or the wiring length
is long, using the offline auto tuning function runs the motor with the optimum operating
characteristics.
Tuning is enabled even when a load is connected to the motor. As the motor may run slightly,
fix the motor securely with a mechanical brake or make sure that there will be no problem in
safety if the motor runs (caution is required especially in elevator). Note that tuning performance is unaffected even if the motor runs slightly.
Reading/writing/copy of motor constants tuned by offline auto tuning are enabled.
The offline auto tuning status can be monitored with the operation panel and PU (FR-PU04/
FR-PU07).

Basic settings

Before performing offline auto tuning
Check the following before performing offline auto tuning.
● Make sure advanced magnetic flux vector control or general-purpose magnetic flux vector
control (Pr. 80, Pr. 81) is selected (refer to section 5.1.7). (Tuning can be performed even
under V/f control selected by turning on X18.)
● A motor should be connected. Note that the motor should be at a stop at a tuning start.
● The motor capacity should be equal to or one rank lower than the inverter capacity. (Note
that the capacity should be 0.1kW or more.)
● The maximum frequency is 120Hz.
● A high-slip motor, high-speed motor and special motor cannot be tuned.
● As the motor may run slightly, fix the motor securely with a mechanical brake or make sure
that there will be no problem in safety if the motor runs (caution is required especially in
elevator). Note that tuning performance is unaffected even if the motor runs slightly.
Setting
 Select advanced magnetic flux vector control or general-purpose magnetic flux vector
control. (Refer to section 5.1.7.)
 Set "1" or "11" in Pr. 96 "Auto tuning setting/status".
– When the setting is "1":
Tune all motor constants without running the motor.
When performing advanced magnetic flux vector control, set "1" to perform tuning.
Depending on the motor type and the inverter capacity it takes approximately 25 to 75s
until tuning is completed.
(Excitation noise is produced during tuning.)
– When the setting is "11":
Tune motor constants (R1) only without running the motor.
When performing general-purpose magnetic flux vector control, set "11" to perform
tuning.
It takes approximately 9s until tuning is completed.
 Set the rated motor current (initial value is rated inverter current) in Pr. 9 "Electronic thermal
O/L relay". (Refer to page 5-2.)
 Set the rated voltage of motor (initial value is 200V) in Pr. 83 "Rated motor voltage" and
rated motor frequency (initial value is 60Hz) in Pr. 84 "Rated motor frequency".
 Set Pr. 71 "Applied motor" according to the motor used.

CAUTION:
Before performing tuning, check the monitor display of the operation panel or
parameter unit (FR-PU04/FR-PU07) if the inverter is in the status for tuning. (Refer to
Tab. 5-4.) When the start command is turned on under V/f control, the motor starts.

When performing tuning or PU operation, press the RUN key of the operation panel or the FWD
or REV key of the parameter unit (FR-PU04/FR-DU07).
For external operation, turn on the run command (STF signal or STR signal). Tuning starts.

NOTES

To force tuning to end, use the MRS or RES signal or press the STOP key of the operation
panel. (Turning the start signal (STF signal or STR signal) off also ends tuning.)
During offline auto tuning, only the following I/O signals are valid: (initial value)
– Input terminal <valid signal> MRS, RES, STF, STR
– Output terminal RUN, AM, A, B, C
Note that the progress status of offline auto tuning is output from AM when speed and output
frequency are selected.
Since the RUN signal turns on when tuning is started, caution is required especially when a
sequence which releases a mechanical brake by the RUN signal has been designed.
When executing offline auto tuning, input the run command after switching on the main circuit power (R/L1, S/L2, T/L3) of the inverter.
Do not perform ON/OFF switching of the second function selection signal (RT) during execution of offline auto tuning. Auto tuning is not excecuted properly.

When tuning is ended forcibly by pressing the STOP-key or turning off the start signal (STF or
STR) during tuning, offline auto tuning does not end normally. (The motor constants have not
been set.) Perform an inverter reset and restart tuning.
When using the motor corresponding to the following specifications and conditions, reset Pr. 9
Electronic thermal O/L relay as below after tuning is completed.
● When the rated power specifications of the motor is 200/220V(400/440V) 60Hz, set 1.1 times
rated motor current value in Pr. 9.
● When performing motor protection from overheat using a PTC thermistor or motor with
temperature detector such as Klixon, set "0" (motor overheat protection by the inverter is
invalid) in Pr. 9.

NOTES

The motor constants measured once in the offline auto tuning are stored as parameters and
their data are held until the offline auto tuning is performed again.
An instantaneous power failure occurring during tuning will result in a tuning error. After
power is restored, the inverter goes into the normal operation mode. Therefore, when STF
(STR) signal is on, the motor runs in the forward (reverse) rotation.
Any alarm occurring during tuning is handled as in the ordinary mode. Note that if an error
retry has been set, retry is ignored.

CAUTION:
As the motor may run slightly during offline auto tuning, fix the motor securely with

runs. Note that if the motor runs slightly, tuning performance is unaffected.

If the proportional band is narrow
(parameter setting is small), the
manipulated variable varies greatly
with a slight change of the measured value.
0.1–1000% Hence, as the proportional band
narrows, the response sensitivity
(gain) improves but the stability
deteriorates, e.g. hunting occurs.

No proportional control.
Time required for only the integral

Control mode

6.2

Parameter

Control mode
V/f control (initial setting), advanced magnetic flux vector control and general-purpose magnetic
flux vector control are available with this inverter.
V/f control
It controls frequency and voltage so that the ratio of frequency (f) to voltage (V) is constant when
changing frequency.
Advanced (general-purpose) magnetic flux vector control
● This control divides the inverter output current into an excitation current and a torque current
by vector calculation and makes voltage compensation to flow a motor current which meets
the load torque. Before operation of a motor in advanced magnetic flux vector control, the
self-setting of motor data must occur.
● General-purpose magnetic flux vector control is the same function as the FR-E500 series.
For other cases, select advanced magnetic flux vector control.

If the following conditions are not satisfied, select V/f control since malfunction such as insufficient torque and uneven rotation may occur.
● The motor capacity should be equal to or one rank lower than the inverter capacity.
● Motor to be used is any of Mitsubishi standard motor, high efficiency motor (SF-JR, SF-HR
0.2kW or more) or Mitsubishi constant torque motor (SF-JRCA four-pole, SF-HRCA 0.4kW
to 15kW). When using a motor other than the above (other manufacturer's motor), perform
offline auto tuning without fail.
● Single-motor operation (one motor run by one inverter) should be performed.
● Wiring length from inverter to motor should be within 30m. (Perform offline auto tuning in
the state where wiring work is performed when the wiring length exceeds 30m.)

Parameter
Control method switching by external terminals (X18 signal)
● Use the V/f switchover signal (X18) to change the control method (V/f control-advanced
magnetic flux vector control (general-purpose magnetic flux vector control)) with external
terminal.
● Turn the X18 signal on to change the currently selected control method (advanced magnetic
flux vector control or general-purpose magnetic flux vector control) to V/f control.
For the terminal used for X18 signal input, set "18" in any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal
function selection" to assign the function.

NOTES

When V/f control is selected by V/f switchover (X18 signal), second function is also selected
at the same time. Control between V/f and advanced (general-purpose) magnetic flux can
not be switched while the inverter is running. In case control is switched between V/f and
advanced (general-purpose) magnetic flux, only second function is selected.
Changing the terminal assignment using Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" may affect the other functions. Make setting after confirming the function of each terminal.

The amount of current flows in the motor may become large according to the conditions
such as the motor characteristics, load, acceleration/deceleration time, wiring length, etc.,
resulting in an overcurrent trip (OL (overcurrent alarm) then E.OC1 (overcurrent trip during
acceleration), overload trip (E.THM (motor overload trip), or E.THT (inverter overload trip).
(When a fault occurs, release the start command, and decrease the Pr. 0 setting 1% by 1%
to reset.)
The Pr. 0, Pr. 46 settings are valid only when V/f control is selected.
When using the inverter dedicated motor (constant torque motor) with the FR-E740-120 and

● Advanced magnetic flux vector control?
The low speed torque can be improved by providing voltage compensation so that the motor

Stall prevention operation
(Pr. 22, Pr. 23, Pr. 48, Pr. 66, Pr. 156, Pr. 157, Pr. 277)

prevent the inverter from coming to trip due to overcurrent, overvoltage, etc. In addition, simple
torque limit which limits the output torque to the predetermined value can be selected.
It can also limit stall prevention and fast-response current limit operation during acceleration/deceleration, driving or regeneration.
● Stall prevention
If the output current exceeds the stall prevention operation level, the output frequency of the
inverter is automatically varied to reduce the output current.
● Fast-response current limit
If the current exceeds the limit value, the output of the inverter is shut off to prevent an
overcurrent.

When Pr. 277 "Stall prevention current switchover" = 1, torque limit can be set.
When output torque (torque current) exceeds the stall prevention operation level, the output frequency is controlled to limit the output torque. For the stall prevention operation level at this time,
the motor rated torque is defined as reference.
NOTES

When driving multiple motors with one inverter, torque limit does not function properly.
Since magnetic flux decreases in the constant output range (Pr. 3 "Base frequency" or
more), the inverter operate with lower torque than the stall prevention operation level.
When torque limit is activated during regeneration, the output frequency is increased up to
the maximum frequency.
Torque limit does not function at 5Hz or less during deceleration.
Note the following when using torque limit under V/f control.
 Capacity of the inverter and motor should be the same.
 Stall prevention operation level (torque limit level) is the rated torque reference of the motor
whose capacity is equivalent to the inverter.
 When Pr. 0 "Torque boost" setting is large, torque limit is likely to occur in the low speed

Adjust the output torque (current) of the motor

Parameter

Setting of stall prevention operation in high frequency range (Pr. 22, Pr. 23, Pr. 66)
During high-speed operation above the rated motor frequency, acceleration may not be made
because the motor current does not increase. If operation is performed in a high frequency
range, the current at motor lockup becomes smaller than the rated output current of the inverter,
and the protective function (OL) is not executed if the motor is at a stop.
To improve the operating characteristics of the motor in this case, the stall prevention level can
be reduced in the high frequency region. This function is effective for performing operation up
to the high-speed range on a centrifugal separator etc.
Pr. 23 sets the change in the current limiting in the frequency range starting at the frequency set
by Pr. 66. For example, if Pr. 66 is set to 75Hz the motor stall prevention operation level at an
output frequency of 150Hz will be reduced to 75% when Pr. 23 is set to 100%, and to 66% when
Pr. 23 is set to 50% (see the formula below). Generally Pr. 66 is set to 50Hz and Pr. 23 to 100%.

Tab. 6-4: Setting of parameter 156 (D = Driving, R = Regeneration)


Since both fast-response current limit and stall prevention are not activated, OL signal and
E.OLT are not output.

The settings "100" and "101" allow operations to be performed in the driving and regeneration modes, respectively. The setting "101" disables the fast-response current limit in the
driving mode.

OL signal is not output at fast-response current limit operation.

6 - 48

Parameter

Adjust the output torque (current) of the motor

NOTES

When the load is heavy or the acceleration/deceleration time is short, stall prevention is
activated and acceleration/deceleration may not be made according to the preset
acceleration/deceleration time. Set Pr. 156 and stall prevention operation level to the
optimum values.
In vertical lift applications, make setting so that the fast-response current limit is not activated. Torque may not be produced, causing a drop due to gravity.

E

FR-E700 EC

CAUTION:
● Do not set a small value as the stall prevention operation current. Otherwise, torque
generated will reduce.
● Always perform test operation.
Stall prevention operation during acceleration may increase the acceleration time.
Stall prevention operation performed during constant speed may cause sudden
speed changes.
Stall prevention operation during deceleration may increase the deceleration time,
increasing the deceleration distance.

Setting of base frequency (Pr. 3)
When operating a standard motor, generally set the rated frequency of the motor to Pr. 3 "Base
frequency".
When running the motor using commercial power supply-inverter switch-over operation, set
Pr. 3 to the same value as the power supply frequency.
If the frequency given on the motor rating plate is "60Hz" only, always set to "60Hz". It may result
in an inverter trip due to overload. Caution must be taken especially when Pr. 14 "Load pattern

Use the second base frequency when you want to change the base frequency, e.g. when using
multiple motors by switching between them by one inverter.
Pr. 47 "Second V/f (base frequency)" is valid when the RT signal is on.

NOTES

The RT signal acts as the second function selection signal and makes the other second
functions valid.
Set "3" in any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" and assign the RT
signal.

Base frequency voltage setting (Pr. 19)
Use Pr. 19 "Base frequency voltage" to set the base voltage (e.g. rated motor voltage). If the setting is less than the power supply voltage, the maximum output voltage of the inverter is as set
in Pr. 19.
Pr. 19 can be utilized in the following cases:
● When regeneration frequency is high (e.g. continuous regeneration)
During regeneration, the output voltage becomes higher than the reference and may cause
an over current trip (E.OC) due to an increased motor current.
● When power supply voltage variation is large
When the power supply voltage exceeds the rated voltage of the motor, speed variation or
motor overheat may be caused by excessive torque or increased motor current.

NOTES

When advanced magnetic flux vector control or general-purpose magnetic flux vector control
is selected, Pr. 3, Pr. 47 and Pr. 19 are invalid and Pr. 83 and Pr. 84 are valid.
Note that Pr. 3 or Pr. 47 value is made valid as inflection points of S-pattern when Pr. 29
"Acceleration/deceleration pattern selection" = 1 (S-pattern acceleration/deceleration A).
Changing the terminal assignment using Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" may affect the other functions. Make setting after confirming the function of each terminal.
Note that the output voltage of the inverter cannot exceed the power supply voltage.

NOTES

When "9999" is set in Pr. 232 "Multi-speed setting (speed 8)", operation is performed at
frequency set in Pr. 6 when RH, RM and RL are turned off and REX is turned on.

In the initial setting, if two or three speeds are simultaneously selected, priority is given to
the set frequency of the lower signal. For example, when the RH and RM signals turn on, the
RM signal (Pr. 5) has a higher priority.
The RH, RM, RL signals are assigned to the terminal RH, RM, RL in the initial setting. By
setting "0 (RL)", "1 (RM)", "2 (RH)" in any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function assignment", you can assign the signals to other terminals.
For the terminal used for REX signal input, set "8" in any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 to assign the
function.

is resumed with that output frequency value. (Pr. 59 = 1)
The frequency is stored at the point when the start signal (STF or STR) turns off or every one
minute after one minute has elapsed since turn off (on) of both the RH (acceleration) and RM
(deceleration) signals. (The frequency is written if the present frequency setting compared with
the past frequency setting every one minute is different. The state of the RL signal does not affect writing.)

When the acceleration or deceleration signal switches on, acceleration/deceleration time is
as set in Pr. 44 and Pr. 45. Note that when long time has been set in Pr. 7 or Pr. 8, the acceleration/deceleration time is as set in Pr. 7 or Pr. 8 (when RT signal is off).
When the RT signal is on, acceleration/deceleration is made in the time set to Pr. 44 and
Pr. 45, regardless of the Pr. 7 or Pr. 8 setting.
If the start signal (STF or STR) is off, turning on the acceleration (RH) or deceleration (RM)
signal varies the preset frequency.
When switching the start signal from ON to OFF, or changing frequency by the RH or RM
signal frequently, set the frequency setting value storage function (write to E²PROM) invalid
(Pr. 59 = 2 or 3). If set valid (Pr. 59 = 1), frequency is written to E²PROM frequently, this will
shorten the life of the E²PROM.

Linear acceleration/deceleration (Pr. 29 = 0, initial value)
For the inverter operation, the output frequency is made to change linearly (linear acceleration/
deceleration) to prevent the motor and inverter from excessive stress to reach the set frequency
during acceleration, deceleration, etc. when frequency changes. Linear acceleration/deceleration has a uniform frequency/time slope (refer to Fig. 6-33).

When a setting of "2" is entered frequency changes are executed with an S-pattern. For
example, if a drive is accelerated from 0 to 30Hz and then re-accelerated to 50Hz then each
acceleration sequence (i.e. the first sequence from 0 to 30Hz and the second from 30Hz to
50Hz) will be executed with an S-pattern. The time for the S-pattern is not longer than that for
linear acceleration (refer to Fig. 6-35). This prevents jolts in drive operation, for example for

Acceleration and deceleration

Parameter

Shortest acceleration/deceleration mode (Pr. 292 = 1, 11, Pr. 293)
● Set when you want to accelerate/decelerate the motor for the shortest time. It is desired to
make acceleration/decelerationin a shorter time for a machine tool etc. but the design values
of machine constants are unknown.
● Acceleration/deceleration speed is automatically adjusted at a start of acceleration/deceleration from the value of the setting value of Pr. 7 "Acceleration time" and Pr. 8 "Deceleration
time" so that acceleration/deceleration is made with the maximum torque the inverter can
output. (The setting values of Pr. 7 and Pr. 8 are not changed.)
● Either acceleration or deceleration can be made in the shortest time using Pr. 293
"Acceleration/deceleration separate selection". When the setting value is "0" (initial value),
both acceleration and deceleration can be made in the shortest time.
● Set "11" when an optional high-duty brake resistor or brake unit is connected. Deceleration
time can be further shortened.
● When the shortest/acceleration mode is selected, the stall prevention operation level during
acceleration/deceleration from the value of becomes 150% (adjustable using Pr. 61 to
Pr. 63). Setting of Pr. 22 "Stall prevention operation level" is used only during a constant
speed operation.
● It is inappropriate to use for the following applications.
– Machine with a large inertia such as a fan (more than 10 times). Since stall prevention
operation will be activated for a long time, this type of machine may be brought to an
alarm stop due to motor overloading, etc.
– It is desired to always perform operation with a constant acceleration/deceleration time.

NOTES

Even if automatic acceleration/deceleration mode has been selected, inputting the jog signal
(jog operation) or RT signal (second function selection) during an inverter stop will switch to
the normal operation and give priority to jog operation or second function selection. Note
that JOG and RT signal input is invalid even if JOG signal and RT signal are input during
operation in automatic acceleration/deceleration mode.
Since acceleration/deceleration is made with the stall prevention operation being activated,
the acceleration/deceleration speed always varies according to the load conditions.
Note that when proper values are set in Pr. 7 and Pr. 8, acceleration/deceleration time may
be shorter than selecting shortest acceleration/deceleration mode.

Purpose

Motor overheat protection (Electronic thermal O/L relay) (Pr. 9, Pr. 51)
The FR-E700 EC frequency inverters have an internal electronic motor protection function that
monitors the motor frequency and motor current. Overload conditions are identified and the motor protection function is triggered on the basis of these two factors, in combination with the rated
motor current. The electronic motor protection function is primarily for protection against overheating at intermediate speeds and high motor torques. The reduced cooling performance of the
motor fan under these conditions is also taken into account.

NOTES

Parameter

Fault by electronic thermal relay function is reset by inverter power reset and reset signal
input. Avoid unnecessary reset and power-off.
When multiple motors are operated by a single inverter, protection cannot be provided by
the electronic thermal relay function. Install an external thermal relay to each motor.
When the difference between the inverter and motor capacities is large and the setting is
small, the protective characteristics of the electronic thermal relay function will be deteriorated. In this case, use an external thermal relay.
A special motor cannot be protected by the electronic thermal relay function. Use the external thermal relay.
The operation time of the transistor protection thermal relay shortens when the Pr. 72 "PWM
frequency selection" setting increases.
Electronic thermal relay does not work when 5 % or less of inverter rated current is set to
electronic thermal relay setting.

Selection and protection of a motor

Parameter

Electronic thermal relay function prealarm (TH) and alarm signal (THP signal)
The alarm signal (THP) is output and electronic thermal relay function prealarm (TH) is displayed when the electronic thermal O/L relay cumulative value reaches 85% of the level set in
Pr. 9 or Pr. 51. If it reaches 100% of the Pr. 9 "Electronic thermal O/L relay setting", a motor overload trip (E.THM) occurs.
NOTE

The prealarm signal "THP" is also issued as soon as the thermal load of the IGBT output
stages of the frequency inverter is 85%. If the load rises further up to 100%, then the thermal
overload protection of the frequency inverter responds and the "E.THT" error message is
shown.
For the terminal used for the THP signal output, assign the function by setting "8 (positive logic)
or 108 (negative logic)" in any of Pr. 190 to Pr. 192 "Output terminal function selection".

● A motor should be connected. Note that the motor should be at a stop at a tuning start.
● The motor capacity should be equal to or one rank lower than the inverter capacity.
● The maximum frequency is 120Hz.
● A high-slip motor, high-speed motor and special motor cannot be tuned.

CAUTION:
As the motor may run slightly, fix the motor securely with a mechanical brake or make
sure that there will be no problem in safety if the motor runs (caution is required
especially in elevator). Note that tuning performance is unaffected even if the motor
runs slightly.
● Offline auto tuning will not be performed properly if it is performed with a surge voltage
suppression filter (FFR-DT) connected between the inverter and motor. Remove it before
starting tuning.
Setting
● Select advanced magnetic flux vector control (refer to section 6.3.2) or general-purpose

– When the setting is "1": Tune all motor constants without running the motor.
When performing advanced magnetic flux vector control, set "1" to perform tuning.
It takes approximately 25 to 75s (depending on the inverter inverter capacity and motor
type) until tuning is completed. (Excitation noise is produced during tuning.)
– When the setting is "11": Tune motor constants (R1) only without running the motor.
When performing general-purpose magnetic flux vector control, set "11" to perform
tuning.
It takes approximately 9s until tuning is completed.

CAUTION:
Before performing tuning, check the monitor display of the operation panel or
parameter unit (FR-PU04/FR-PU07) if the inverter is in the status for tuning (refer to
Tab. 6-13). When the start command is turned on under V/f control, the motor starts.

When performing tuning or PU operation, press the RUN key of the operation panel or the FWD
or REV key of the parameter unit (FR-PU04/FR-PU07).
For external operation, turn on the run command (STF signal or STR signal). Tuning starts.

NOTES

To force tuning to end, use the MRS or RES signal or press the STOP/RESET key of the
operation panel. (Turning the start signal (STF signal or STR signal) off also ends tuning.)
During offline auto tuning, only the following I/O signals are valid: (initial value)
– Input terminal:
MRS, RES, STF, STR
– Output terminal:
RUN, AM, A, B, C
Note that the progress status of offline auto tuning is output in eight steps from AM when
speed and output frequency are selected.
Since the RUN signal turns on when tuning is started, caution is required especially when a
sequence which releases a mechanical brake by the RUN signal has been designed.
When executing offline auto tuning, input the run command after switching on the main circuit power (R/L1, S/L2, T/L3) of the inverter.
Do not perform ON/OFF switching of the second function selection signal (RT) during execution of offline autotuning. Auto tuning is not excecuted properly.
Do not connect a surge voltage suppression filter (FFR-DT) between the inverter and motor.

When using the motor corresponding to the following specifications and conditions, reset Pr. 9
Electronic thermal O/L relay as below after tuning is completed.
● When the rated power specifications of the motor is 200/220V(400/440V) 60Hz, set 1.1 times
rated motor current value in Pr. 9.
● When performing motor protection from overheat using a PTC thermistor or motor with
temperature detector such as Klixon, set "0" (motor overheat protection by the inverter is
invalid) in Pr. 9.

NOTES

The motor constants measured once in the offline auto tuning are stored as parameters and
their data are held until the offline auto tuning is performed again.
An instantaneous power failure occurring during tuning will result in a tuning error. After
power is restored, the inverter goes into the normal operation mode. Therefore, when STF
(STR) signal is on, the motor runs in the forward (reverse) rotation.
Any alarm occurring during tuning is handled as in the ordinary mode. Note that if a fault
retry has been set, retry is ignored.

NOTES

For the FR-E740-120 and 170, when the Pr. 12 setting is the following, changing the Pr. 71
"Applied motor" setting automatically changes the Pr. 12 setting. Therefore, it is not
necessary to change the Pr. 12 setting.
Parameter 12 = 4% (initial value)
The Pr. 12 setting is automatically changed to 2% if the Pr. 71 value is changed from the
value selecting the standard motor (0, 3 to 6, 23, 24, 40, 43, 44) to the value selecting the

selecting the standard motor (0, 3 to 6, 23, 24, 40, 43, 44).
Even if the Pr. 12 setting is increased, braking torque is limited so that the output current is

To ensure accurate positioning at the upper limit etc. of a lift, stop-on-contact control causes a
mechanical brake to be closed while the motor is developing a holding torque to keep the load
in contact with a mechanical stopper etc. This function suppresses vibration which is liable to occur when the load is stopped upon contact in vertical motion applications, ensuring steady precise positioning.

control.
● Set "1" in Pr. 270 "Stop-on contact control selection".
● Set output frequency during stop-on-contact control in Pr. 6 "Multi-speed setting (low
speed)".
The frequency should be as low as possible (about 2Hz). If it is set to more than 30Hz, the
operating frequency will be 30Hz.
● When both the RT and RL signals are switched on, the inverter enters the stop-on-contact
mode, in which operation is performed at the frequency set in Pr. 6 independently of the
preceding speed.
● For the terminal used for X18 signal input, set "3" in any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal
function selection" and "0" in Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" to assign
the function.

NOTES

By increasing the Pr. 275 setting, the low-speed (stop-on-contact) torque increases, but
overcurrent fault (E.OCT) may occur or the machine may oscillate in a stop-on-contact state.
The stop-on-contact function is diferent from servo-lock function, and if used to stop or hold
a load for an extended period, this function can cause the motor to overheat. After a stop,
immediately change to a mechanical brake to hold the load.
Under the following operating conditions, the stop-on-contact functionis made invalid:

NOTES

Parameter

Changing the terminal assignment using Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function
selection" may affect the other functions. Please make setting after confirming the function of
each terminal.
One function can be assigned to two or more terminals. In this case, the terminal inputs are
ORed.
The priorities of the speed commands are in order of jog, multi-speed setting (RH, RM, RL,
REX) and PID (X14).
When the X10 signal (FR-HC, FR-CV connection - inverter operation enable signal) is not
set, the MRS signal shares this function.
When the PU operation external interlock (X12) signal is not assigned at the Pr. 79 "Operation mode selection" setting of "7", the MRS signal shares this function.
Use common terminals to assign multi-speeds (7 speeds) and remote setting. They cannot
be set individually. (Common terminals are used since these functions are designed for
speed setting and need not be set at the same time.)
When V/f control is selected by V/f switchover (X18 signal), second function is also selected
at the same time. Control between V/f and advanced (general-purpose) magnetic flux can
not be switched during operation. In case control is switched between V/f and advanced
(general-purpose) magnetic flux, only second function is selected.
Turning the AU signal on makes terminal 2 (voltage input) invalid.

Response time of each signal
The response time of the X10 signal and MRS signal is within 2ms.
The response time of other signals is within 20ms.

● To provide interlock to disable operation by the inverter.
With the MRS signal on, the inverter cannot be operated if the start signal is entered into
the inverter.
● Coast the motor to a stop.
When the start signal is turned off, the inverter decelerates the motor to a stop in the preset

The above parameter can be set when Pr. 160 "User group read selection" = 0.

2-wire type (terminals STF and STR)
A two-wire type connection is shown below.
In the initial setting, the forward/reverse rotation signals (STF/STR) are used as start and stop
signals. Turn on either of the forward and reverse rotation signals to start the motor in the corresponding direction. If both are turned off (or on) during operation, the inverter decelerates to
a stop.
The speed setting signal may either be given by entering 0 to 10V DC across the speed setting
input terminal 2-5, by setting the required values in Pr. 4 to Pr. 6 "Multi-speed setting" (high, middle, low speeds), etc. (For multi-speed operation, refer to section 6.6.1).
When Pr. 250 is set to any of "1000 to 1100, 8888", the STF signal becomes a start command
and the STR signal a forward/reverse command.

the forward/reverse rotation signal functions only as a start signal.
If the start signal (STF or STR) is turned on and then off, the start signal is held and makes a start.
When changing the direction of rotation, turn STR (STF) on once and then off. To stop the inverter, turning off the STOP signal once decelerates it to a stop. When using the STOP signal,

Note that when the frequency setting is varied using an analog signal or the digital dial of
the operation panel, the output of the SU (up to frequency) signal may alternate on and off
depending on that varying speed and the timing of the varying speed due to acceleration/
deceleration time setting. (The output will not alternate on and off when the acceleration/
deceleration time setting is "0s".)

The same function may be set to more than one terminal.
When the function is executed, the terminal conducts at the setting of any of "0" to "99", and
does not conduct at the setting of any of "100" to "199".
Changing the terminal assignment using Pr. 190 to Pr. 192 "Output terminal function selection" may affect the other functions. Make setting after confirming the function of each terminal.
Do not assign signals which repeat frequent ON/OFF to A, B, and C. Otherwise, the life of

Function assignment of external terminals

Parameter

Output frequency detection (FU, Pr. 42, Pr. 43)
The output frequency detection signal (FU) is output when the output frequency reaches or exceeds the Pr. 42 setting. This function can be used for electromagnetic brake operation, open
signal, etc.
When the detection frequency is set to Pr. 43, frequency detection for reverse operation use only
can also be set. This function is effective for switching the timing of electromagnetic brake operation between forward rotation (rise) and reverse rotation (fall) during vertical lift operation,etc.
When Pr. 43 ≠ 9999, the Pr. 42 setting is used for forward rotation and the Pr. 43 setting is used
for reverse rotation.

NOTES

The FU signal is assigned to the terminal FU in the initial setting. The FU signal can also be
assigned to the other terminal by setting "4 (positive logic) or 104 (negative logic)" in any of
Pr. 190 to Pr. 192.
All signals are off during DC injection brake.
The output frequency to be compared with the set frequency is the output frequency before
slip compensation is performed.

Parameter

Zero current detection (Y13, Pr. 152, Pr. 153)
If the output current remains lower than the Pr. 152 setting during inverter operation for longer
than the time set in Pr. 153, the zero current detection (Y13) signal is output from the inverter's
open collector or relay output terminal. As soon as the signal is output to terminal Y13, it remains
turned on for 100ms.
When the inverter's output current falls to "0", torque will not be generated. This may cause a
drop due to gravity when the inverter is used in vertical lift application. To prevent this, the output
current zero signal (Y13) can be output from the inverter to close the mechanical brake when the
output current has fallen to "zero".
Set "13" (source logic) or "113" (sink logic) to any of Pr. 190 to Pr. 192 "Output terminal function
selection" to assign the function of the output power detection signal (Y13) to the output terminal.

CAUTION:
The zero current detection level setting should not be too high, and the zero current
detection time setting not too long. Otherwise, the detection signal may not be output
when torque is not generated at a low output current.

of the zero current detection signal, install a safety backup such as an emergency

Function assignment of external terminals
When Pr. 495 = 0 or 10, performing a power supply reset (including a power failure) clears the
REM signal output. (The ON/OFF states of the terminals are as set in Pr. 190 to Pr. 192.) The
Pr. 496 and Pr. 497 settings are also "0".
When Pr. 495 = 1 or 11, the remote output data before power supply-off is stored into the
E²PROM, so the signal output at power recovery is the same as before power supply-off. However, it is not stored when the inverter is reset (terminal reset, reset request through communication). (See the chart below).
When Pr. 495 = 10 or 11, signal before rest is saved even at inverter reset.

The above parameters can be set when Pr. 160 "User group read selection" = 0.
The maximum value of the setting range differs according to the Pr. 1 "Maximum frequency" (Parameter 18 "High speed maximum frequency") and it can be calculated from the following formula:

Machine speed conversion formula: Pr. 37 × frequency/60Hz
Hz is displayed in 0.01Hz increments and machine speed is in 0.001.

Under V/f control, the output frequency of the inverter is displayed in terms of synchronous
speed, and therefore, displayed value = actual speed + motor slip. The display changes to
the actual speed (estimated value calculated based on the motor slip) when advanced magnetic flux vector control was selected or slip compensation was made valid.
Refer to Pr. 52 when you want to change the PU main monitor (PU main display).
Since the panel display of the operation panel is 4 digits in length, the monitor value of more
than "9999" is displayed "----".
When the machine speed is displayed on the FR-PU04/FR-PU07, do not change the speed
by using an up/down key in the state where the set speed exceeding 65535 is displayed.
The set speed may become arbitrary value.
While the machine speed is displayed on the monitor, values of other parameters related to
speed (Pr. 1, etc.) are in frequency increments. Set other parameters (Pr. 1, etc) related to
speed in increments of frequency.
Due to the limitations on the resolution of the set frequency, the indication in the second decimal place may differ from the setting.
When frequency or set frequency is monitored from network option card except for
FR-A7NC E kit, frequency is displayed for monitor description regardless of Pr. 37 setting.

Calibrate the terminal AM gain in the following procedure:
 Connect an 0–10V DC voltmeter to inverter terminals AM and 5, taking care to correct with
the correct polarity. AM is positive.
 Set Pr. 158 to select the monitor signal you want to output to analog output AM (refer to
page 6-146). To display the output frequency or the output current set Pr. 55 or Pr. 56,
respectively, to the maximum frequency or current value for which you want to output 10V
to the terminal.
 Start the frequency inverter in PU mode with the operation panel or the control terminals
(external operation).
 Calibrate the full deflection of the meter by setting C1 (Pr. 901) and then operating the digital
dial. Note that the value shown on the operating panel for the monitor signal associated with
C1 does not change when you turn the digital dial, but the analog voltage output to AM will
change as you turn the dial. Confirm the calibration value found by pressing the SET key
(this assigns the maximum voltage output to the displayed value of the monitor signal.)

NOTE

FR-E700 EC

If it is not possible output the signal to be measured for calibration at its maximum value you
can set Pr. 158 to "21". This outputs a continuous signal of approx. 10V to terminal AM,
which makes it possible to calibrate the maximum value on the meter. When C1 is used to
calibrate the full meter deflection in this mode a value of "1000" is displayed. Afterwards you
can then reset Pr. 158 to the required monitor signal setting.

Operation selection at power failure

NOTES

Speed detection time (frequency search) changes according to the motor speed (maximum
100ms).
Frequency search errors can occur if the output capacity of the frequency inverter is one or
more classes higher than that of the motor or if the motor is a special model (e.g. with a frequency rating above 60Hz). If this happens it is possible for over current error messages
(OCT) to be generated during motor acceleration. In such configurations flying restarts are
not possible and the frequency search function should not be used.
At motor frequencies of 10Hz or less the inverter accelerates from 0Hz to the set frequency.
If more than one motor is connected to the inverter in parallel the frequency search on automatic restart does not work correctly and over current error messages (OCT) are likely. In
such configurations deactivate frequency search (set Pr. 162 to "1" or "11").
When reverse rotation is detected when Pr. 78 = 1 (reverse rotation disabled), the rotation
direction is changed to forward rotation after decelerates in reverse rotation when the start
command is forward rotation. The inverter will not start when the start command is reverse
rotation.
When automatic restart operation after instantaneous power failure is activated while the
motor is running at a low speed (less than 10Hz), the motor restarts in the direction prior to
instantaneous power failure without detecting the rotation direction (Pr. 299 "Rotation direction detection selection at restarting" = 1).
If the frequency search result exceeds the set frequency, the output frequency is limited at
the set frequency.
When the wiring length exceeds 100m, select without frequency search (Pr. 162 = 1 or 11).

performed at the second time or later.
● Automatic restart operation selection of MRS (X10) signal
Restart operation after turning MRS (X10) signal on then off using Pr. 30 can be selected

of the load or running frequency. Adjust the coasting time between 0.1s and 5s according to the
load specifications.
Restart cushion time (Pr. 58)
Cushion time is the length of time when the voltage appropriate to the voltage at the detected

Parameter

Operation selection at power failure
Frequency search gain (Pr. 298), offline auto tuning (Pr. 96)
When automatic restart after instantaneous power failure operation (with frequency search) is
valid at V/f control, perform offline auto tuning. Perform offline auto tuning during V/f control in
the following order to set Pr. 298 "Frequency search gain" automatically. (Refer to page 6-88
during advanced magnetic flux vector control and general-purpose magnetic flux vector control.)
Before performing offline auto tuning
Check the following before performing offline auto tuning:
● The inverter is under V/f control.
● A motor should be connected. Note that the motor should be at a stop at a tuning start.
● The motor capacity should be equal to or one rank lower than the inverter capacity.
● The maximum frequency is 120Hz.
● A high-slip motor, high-speed motor and special motor cannot be tuned.
● Even if tuning is performed without motor running (Pr. 96 "Auto tuning setting/status" = 21),
the motor may run slightly. Therefore, fix the motor securely with a mechanical brake, or
before tuning, make sure that there will be no problem in safety if the motor runs (caution is
required especially in vertical lift applications). Note that tuning performance is unaffected
even if the motor runs slightly.
● Offline auto tuning will not be performed properly if it is performed with a surge voltage
suppression filter (FFR-DT) connected between the inverter and motor. Remove it before
starting tuning.
Setting
● Set "21" in Pr. 96 "Auto tuning setting/status". Tuning is performed without motor running.
According to the motor type and the inverter capacity, it takes approximately 9s until tuning
is completed. (Excitation noise is produced during tuning.)
● Set the rated motor current (initial value is rated inverter current) in Pr. 9 "Electronic thermal
O/L relay". (Refer to section 6.8).
● Set Pr. 71 "Applied motor" according to the motor used.

CAUTION:
Before performing tuning, check the monitor display of the operation panel or
parameter unit (FR-PU04/FR-PU07) if the inverter is in the status for tuning. (Refer to
Tab. 6-13).

When performing tuning or PU operation, press the RUN key of the operation panel.
For external operation, turn on the run command (STF signal or STR signal). Tuning starts.

NOTES

To force tuning to end, use the MRS or RES signal or press the STOP key of the operation
panel. (Turning the start signal (STF signal or STR signal) off also ends tuning.)
During offline auto tuning, only the following I/O signals are valid: (initial value)
– Input terminal <valid signal> MRS, RES, STF, STR
– Output terminal RUN, AM, A, B, C
Note that the progress status of offline auto tuning is output from AM when speed and output
frequency are selected.
Since the RUN signal turns on when tuning is started, caution is required especially when a
sequence which releases a mechanical brake by the RUN signal has been designed.
When executing offline auto tuning, input the run command after switching on the main circuit power (R/L1, S/L2, T/L3) of the inverter.
Do not perform ON/OFF switching of the second function selection signal (RT) during execution of offline auto tuning. Auto tuning is not excecuted properly.

When using the motor corresponding to the following specifications and conditions, reset Pr.9
Electronic thermal O/L relay as below after tuning is completed.
● When the rated power specifications of the motor is 200/220V(400/440V) 60Hz, set 1.1 times
rated motor current value in Pr. 9.
● When performing motor protection from overheat using a PTC thermistor or motor with
temperature detector such as Klixon, set "0" (motor overheat protection by the inverter is
invalid) in Pr. 9.

NOTES

The motor constants measured once in the offline auto tuning are stored as parameters and
their data are held until the offline auto tuning is performed again.
An instantaneous power failure occurring during tuning will result in a tuning error. After
power is restored, the inverter goes into the normal operation mode. Therefore, when STF
(STR) signal is on, the motor runs in the forward (reverse) rotation.
Any alarm occurring during tuning is handled as in the ordinary mode. Note that if an error
retry has been set, retry is ignored.
The set frequency monitor displayed during the offline auto tuning is 0Hz.
Changing the terminal assignment using Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" may affect the other functions. Make setting after confirming the function of each terminal.
The SU and FU signals are not output during a restart. They are output after the restart

Parameter

Operation setting at alarm occurrence
Retry operation automatically resets a fault and restarts the inverter at the starting frequency
when the time set in Pr. 68 elapses after the inverter is tripped.
Retry operation is performed by setting Pr. 67 to any value other than "0". Set the number of retries at fault occurrence in Pr. 67. When retries fail consecutively more than the number of times
set in Pr. 67, a retry count excess fault (E.RET) occurs, resulting in inverter trip. (Refer to retry
failure example in Fig. 6-87.)
Use Pr. 68 to set the waiting time from when the inverter trips until a retry is made in the range
0 to 360s. (When the setting value is "0s", the actual time is 0.1s.)
Reading the Pr. 69 value provides the cumulative number of successful restart times made by
retry. The cumulative count in Pr. 69 is increased by 1 when a retry is regarded as successful
after normal operation continues without faults occurring for more than four times longer than
the time set in Pr. 68 after a retry start. (When retry is successful, cumulative number of retry failure is cleared.) Writing "0" to Pr. 69 clears the cumulative count.
During a retry, the Y64 signal is on. For the Y64 signal, assign the function by setting "64 (positive operation)" or "164 (negative operation)" to any of Pr. 190 to Pr. 192 "Output terminal function selection".

Output phase failure protection selection (Pr. 251)
If phase loss occurs during inverter running (except for during DC brake operation, or output frequency is 1Hz or less), output phase loss protection (E.LF) activates, and inverter trips.
When Pr. 251 is set to "0", output phase failure protection (E.LF) becomes invalid.
Input phase failure protection selection (Pr. 872)
When Pr. 872 is set to "1", input phase failure protection (E.ILF) is provided if a phase failure of
one phase among the three phases is detected for 1s continuously.

NOTES

If an input phase failure continues for a long time during inverter operation, the converter
section and capacitor lives of the inverter will be shorter.
As phase loss is detected according to the bus voltage change, it can not be detected if the
load is light. Also, if the power supply voltage is imbalanced, phase loss is less likely
detected.
Phase loss can not be detected during regeneration load operation.
If parameter copy is performed from single-phase power input specification model to threephase power input specification model, Pr. 872 setting may be changed. Check Pr. 872 setting after parameter copy.

Optimum excitation control mode (OEC) (Pr. 60 = 9)
When "9" is set in Pr. 60, the inverter operates in the optimum excitation control mode.
The optimum excitation control mode is a control system which controls excitation current to improve the motor efficiency to maximum and determines output voltage as an energy saving
method.

NOTES

When the motor capacity is too small as compared to the inverter capacity or two or more
motors are connected to the inverter, the energy saving effect is not expected.
When the optimum excitation control mode is selected, deceleration time may be longer
than the setting value. Since overvoltage alarm tends to occur as compared to the constant
torque load characteristics, set a longer deceleration time.
Optimum excitation control functions only under V/f control. Optimum excitation control does
not function under advanced magnetic flux vector control and general-purpose magnetic flux
vector control.
Optimum excitation control will not be performed during an automatic restart after instantaneous power failure.
Since output voltage is controlled by optimum excitation control, output current may slightly
increase.

PWM carrier frequency changing (Pr. 72)
You can change the PWM carrier frequency of the inverter.
Changing the PWM carrier frequency produces an effect on avoiding the resonance frequency
of a mechanical system or motor or on reducing noise or leakage current generated from the
inverter.
Soft-PWM control (Pr. 240)
Soft-PWM control is a control system that changes the motor noise from a metallic tone into
an unoffending complex tone.

NOTES

Decreasing the PWM carrier frequency reduces inverter-generated noise and leakage current, but increases motor noise.
When PWM carrier frequency is set to 1kHz or less (Pr. 72 ≤ 1), fast response current limit
may function prior to stall prevention operation due to increase in ripple currents, resulting in
insufficient torque. In such case, set fast-response current limit operation invalid using
Pr. 156 "Stall prevention operation selection".
When setting 2kHz or more in Pr. 72 to perform operation in the place where the ambient
temperature exceeding 40°C, caution should be taken as the rated inverter current should
be reduced. (Refer to appendix A-1.)

Change the frequency at maximum analog input (Pr. 125, Pr. 126)
Set a value to Pr. 125 (Pr. 126) when changing only the frequency setting (gain) of the maximum
analog input power (current). (C2 (Pr. 902) to C7 (Pr. 905) setting need not be changed.)
Analog input bias/gain calibration [C2 (Pr. 902) to C7 (Pr. 905)]
The parameters for input bias and gain can be used to configure the inverter for set point signals
that do not exactly match 5V or 10V or 20mA. You can enter the exact output frequencies to
be associated with the minimum and maximum signal values separately for terminals 2 and 4.
This feature can also be used to configure an inverse control characteristic (i.e. high output
frequency at minimum set point signal, minimum output frequency at maximum set point signal).
Set the bias frequency of the terminal 2 input using C2 (Pr. 902). (Factory-set to the frequency
at 0V.)
Parameter C3 (Pr. 902) is the frequency setting bias for the input signal at terminal 2, i.e. the
minimum value of the analog signal. When signals are smaller than this value the frequency
set point signal will be limited to the value set with C2.
Parameter 125 sets the gain for the terminal 2 output frequency. This is the frequency set point
value that corresponds to the maximum analog signal defined with Pr. 73. (Pr. 125 is set to a
default value of 50Hz at the factory.)
Parameter C4 (Pr. 903) sets the gain for the input signal on terminal 2, i.e. the maximum value
of the analog signal connected to terminal 2. When signals exceed this value the frequency set
point value is limited to the value stored in Pr. 125.
Parameter C5 (Pr. 904) sets the frequency set point bias frequency for terminal 4. This is the
frequency corresponding to the minimum analog signal. (This parameter is set to a default value
of 0Hz at the factory.)
Parameter C6 (Pr. 904) sets the bias of the input signal on terminal 4, i.e. the minimum value
of the analog signal connected to terminal 4. When the signal on this terminal is lower than this
value the frequency set point value is limited to the value set with C5. (This parameter is set to
a default value of 20% at the factory, which corresponds to approx. 4mA.)
Parameter 126 sets the gain for the terminal 4 output frequency. This is the frequency set point
value that corresponds to the maximum analog signal defined with Pr. 73. (Pr. 126 is set to a
default value of 50Hz at the factory.)
Parameter C7 (Pr. 905) sets the gain of the input signal on terminal 4, i.e. the maximum value
of the analog signal connected to terminal 4. When the signal on this terminal is higher than
this value the frequency set point value is limited to the value set with Pr. 126.

When Pr. 75 is set to any of "1, 3, 15, 17", a reset can be input only when the inverter is tripped.

NOTES

When the reset signal (RES) is input during operation, the motor coasts since the inverter
being reset shuts off the output. Also, the cumulative value of the electronic thermal relay
function and the regenerative brake duty are cleared.
The reset key of the PU is valid only when the protective function is activated, independently
of the Pr. 75 setting.

Disconnected PU detection
This function detects that the PU (FR-PU04/FR-PU07) has been disconnected from the inverter
for longer than 1s and causes the inverter to provide an alarm output (E.PUE) and come to an
alarm stop.
When Pr. 75 is set to any of "0, 1, 14, 15", operation is continued if the PU is disconnected.

NOTES

When the PU has been disconnected since before power-on, it is not judged as an alarm.
To make a restart, confirm that the PU is connected and then reset the inverter.
The motor decelerates to a stop when the PU is disconnected during PU jog operation with
Pr. 75 set to any of "0, 1, 14, 15" (operation is continued if the PU is disconnected).
When RS-485 communication operation is performed through the PU connector, the reset
selection/PU stop selection function is valid but the disconnected PU detection function is
invalid.

Parameter

Misoperation prevention and parameter setting restriction
PU stop selection
In any of the PU operation, external operation and network operation modes, the motor can be
stopped by pressing the STOP key of the PU.
When the inverter is stopped by the PU stop function (refer to section 4.3 "Operation panel") in
the external operation mode, "PS" is displayed but an alarm is not output. An alarm output is not
provided.
After the motor is stopped from the PU, it is necessary to perform PU stop (PS) reset to restart.
PS reset can be made from the unit from which PU stop is made (operation panel, parameter unit
(FR-PU04/PU07, operation panel for FR-E500 (PA02)).
The motor can be restarted by making PS cancel using a power supply reset or RES signal.
When Pr. 75 is set to any of "0 to 3", PU stop (PS display) is invalid, deceleration to a stop by the
STOP key is valid only in the PU operation mode.

NOTE

FR-E700 EC

During operation in the PU operation mode through USB communication or RS-485 communication from the PU connector, the motor decelerates to stop (PU stop) when STOP is
entered from the operation panel.

Parameter

External operation mode (Pr. 79 = 0, 2)
Select the external operation mode when performing operation by providing a frequency setting
potentiometer, start switch, etc. externally and connecting them to the control circuit terminals
of the inverter.
Basically, parameter changing is disabled in external operation mode. (Some parameters can
be changed. Refer to Tab. 6-1 for the parameter list.)
When "0" or "2" is selected for Pr. 79, the inverter enters the external operation mode at power
on. (When using the network operation mode, refer to section 6.18.2).
If you don’t need to change the parameter settings frequently you can set the unit to external
mode permanently by setting Pr. 79 to "2". (If you need to change parameter settings frequently
external mode should be activated by setting Pr. 79 to "0". Then the frequency inverter will switch
to external mode automatically when the power is switched on but it can be switched to PU mode
by pressing the PU/EXT key. You can then make the parameter changes in PU mode and switch
back to external mode again afterwards by pressing PU/EXT again.)
The STF and STR signal are used as a start command, and the terminal 2, 4, multi-speed setting, JOG signal, etc. are used as frequency setting.

WARNING:
When using switch-over mode please note that in some switch-over operations the
rotation direction command and the frequency setting value are "transferred" to the
"new" operating mode (refer to Tab. 6-52 for details). When this happens the drive will
run in the new operating mode even though it has not (yet) received any control
commands.
It is extremely important to take this into account and take the necessary steps to
ensure that performing these switch-over operations cannot cause hazardous conditions.

Selection of operation mode and operation location

Parameter

PU operation interlock (Pr. 79 = 7)
The PU operation interlock function is designed to forcibly change the operation mode to external operation mode when the PU operation interlock signal (X12) input turns off.
This function prevents the inverter from being inoperative by the external command if the mode
is accidentally left unswitched from the PU operation mode.
Set "7" (PU operation interlock) in Pr. 79. For the terminal used for X12 signal (PU operation interlock signal) input, set "12" to any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" to assign the function. (Refer to section 6.10.1 for Pr. 178 to Pr. 184.) When the X12 signal has not
been assigned, the function of the MRS signal switches from MRS (output stop) to the PU operation interlock signal.

Tab. 6-54: Switching the X12 (MRS) signal


The operation mode switches to external operation mode independently of whether the start
signal (STF, STR) is on or off. Therefore, the motor is run in external operation mode when
the X12 (MRS) signal is turned off with either of STF and STR on.
 At alarm occurrence, pressing the STOP/RESET key of the operation panel resets the
inverter.

NOTES

If the X12 (MRS) signal is on, the operation mode cannot be switched to PU operation mode
when the start signal (STF, STR) is on.
When the MRS signal is used as the PU interlock signal, the MRS signal serves as the normal MRS function (output stop) by turning on the MRS signal and then changing the Pr. 79
value to other than "7" in the PU operation mode. Also as soon as "7" is set in Pr. 79, the signal acts as the PU interlock signal.
When the MRS signal is used as the PU operation interlock signal, the logic of the signal is
as set in Pr. 17. When Pr. 17 = 2, read ON as OFF and OFF as ON in the above explanation.
Changing the terminal assignment using Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal function selection" may affect the other functions. Please make setting after confirming the function of
each terminal.

Parameter

Selection of operation mode and operation location
Switching of operation mode by external terminal (X16)
When external operation and operation from the operation panel are used together, use of the
PU-external operation switching signal (X16) allows switching betwen the PU operation mode
and external operation mode during a stop (during a motor stop, start command off).
When Pr. 79 = any of "0, 6, 7", the operation mode can be switched between the PU operation
mode and external operation mode. (Pr. 79 = 6 switch-over mode can be changed during operation)
For the terminal used for X16 signal input, set "16" to any of Pr. 178 to Pr. 184 "Input terminal

When data receive errors occur consecutively and exceed the permissible number of retries set,
an inverter trips (E.PUE) and a motor stops (as set in Pr. 502).
When "9999" is set, an inverter fault is not provided even if data receive error occurs but an alarm
signal (LF) is output.

Parameter

Communication operation and setting
Signal loss detection (Pr. 122)
If a signal loss (communication stop) is detected between the inverter and master as a result of
a signal loss detection, a communication fault (E.PUE) occurs and the inverter trips (as set in
Pr. 502).
When the setting is "9999", communication check (signal loss detection) is not made.
When the setting value is "0" (initial value), RS-485 communication can be made. However, a
communication fault (E.PUE) occurrs as soon as the inverter is switched to the operation mode
(network operation mode in the initial setting) with the control.
A signal loss detection is made when the setting is any of "0.1s to 999.8s". To make a signal loss
detection, it is necessary to send data (refer to Mitsubishi inverter protcol control code (page
6-237), Modbus-RTU comunciation protocol (page 6-253)) from the computer within the communication check time interval. (The inverter makes communication check (clearing of communication check counter) regardless of the station number setting of the data sent from the
master).
Communication check is made from the first communication in the operation mode with control
source valid (network operation mode in the initial setting).

NOTES

Always set the communication check time interval before starting operation to prevent hazardous conditions.
Data communication is not started automatically but is made only once when the computer
provides a communication request. If communication is disabled during operation due to signal cable breakage etc., the inverter cannot be stopped. When the communication check
time interval has elapsed, the inverter will come to an alarm stop (E.PUE). The inverter can
be coasted to a stop by switching on its RES signal or by switching power off.
If communication is broken due to signal cable breakage, computer fault etc., the inverter
does not detect such a fault. This should be fully noted.

NOTES

The fault output indicates fault output signal (ALM signal) or alarm bit output.
When the setting was made to provide a fault output, the fault description is stored into the
faults history. (The fault description is written to the faults history when a fault output is provided.) When no fault output is provided, the fault definition overwrites the fault indication of
the faults history temporarily, but is not stored. After the fault is removed, the fault indication
returns to the ordinary monitor, and the faults history returns to the preceding fault indication.
When the Pr. 502 setting is "1 or 2", the deceleration time is the ordinary deceleration time
setting (e.g. Pr. 8, Pr. 44, Pr. 45). In addition, acceleration time for restart is the normal
acceleration time (e.g. Pr. 7, Pr. 44).
When "2" is set in Pr. 502, run command/speed command at restarting follows the command
before an fault occurrence.
When "2" is set in Pr. 502 at occurrence of a communication error and the error is removed
during deceleration, the inverter accelerates again at that point.

If a data error is detected and a retry must be made, execute retry operation with the user
program. The inverter comes to an alarm stop if the number of consecutive retries exceeds
the parameter setting.

On receipt of a data error occurrence, the inverter returns "reply data " to the computer
again. The inverter comes to an alarm stop if the number of consecutive data errors reaches
or exceeds the parameter setting.
Communication operation presence/absence and data format types
Data communication between the computer and inverter is made in ASCII code (hexadecimal
code). Data is automatically converted to ASCII format when it is exchanged between an external computer and the frequency inverter. In the following table the different data formats are
referred to with the letters A–F. The corresponding formats are explained in the next section.

Communication operation and setting
Instructions for the program
When data from the computer has any error, the inverter does not accept that data. Hence, in
the user program, always insert a retry program for data error.
All data communication, e.g. run command or monitoring, are started when the computer gives
a communication request. The inverter does not return any data without the computer's request.
Hence, design the program so that the computer gives a data read request for monitoring, etc.

NOTES

Always set the communication check time interval before starting operation to prevent hazardous conditions.
Data communication is not started automatically but is made only once when the computer
provides a communication request. If communication is disabled during operation due to signal cable breakage etc., the inverter cannot be stopped. When the communication check
time interval has elapsed, the inverter will come to an alarm stop (E.PUE). The inverter can
be coasted to a stop by switching on its RES signal or by switching power off.
If communication is broken due to signal cable breakage, computer fault etc., the inverter
does not detect such a fault. This should be fully noted.

NOTES

When Modbus-RTU communication is performed from the master with address 0 (station
number 0) set, broadcast communication is selected and the inverter does not send a
response message. When response from the inverter is necessary, set a value other than
"0" (initial value is 0) in Pr. 117 "PU communication station number". Some functions are
invalid for broadcast communication. (Refer to page 6-254.)

When "1" (Modbus-RTU protocol) is set in Pr. 549 and "384" (38400bps) in Pr. 118, parameter
unit (FR-PU04/FR-PU07) is disabled. When using the parameter unit (FR-PU04/FR-PU07),
change parameter using the operation panel.
When using the Modbus-RTU protocol, set Pr. 549 "Protocol selection" to "1".
When PU connector is selected as NET mode operation source (when Pr. 550 "NET mode
operation command source selection" = 2 or 9999 (initial value) without communication
option), Modbus RTU communication operation can be performed. (Refer to section 6.19.2).

Communication operation and setting
Outline
The Modbus protocol is the communication protocol developed by Modicon for PLC.
The Modbus protocol performs serial communication between the master and slave using the
dedicated message frame. The dedicated message frame has the functions that can perform
data read and write. Using the functions, you can read and write the parameter values from the
inverter, write the input command of the inverter, and check the operating status. In this product,
the inverter data are classified in the holding register area (register addresses 40001 to 49999).
By accessing the assigned holding register address, the master can communicate with the inverter which is a slave.

NOTE

There are two different serial transmission modes: ASCII (American Standard Code for
Information Interchange) mode and RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) mode. This product supports only the RTU mode in which two hexadecimal coded characters are transmitted in one
byte (8 bit) data. Only the communication protocol is defined by the Modbus protocol, and
the physical layer is not stipulated.

Tab. 6-81: Data check time
● Query
The master sends a message to the slave (= inverter) at the specified address.
● Normal
Response after receiving the query from the master, the slave executes the requested
function and returns the corresponding normal response to the master.
● Error Response
If an invalid function code, address or data is received, the slave returns it to the master.
When a response description is returned, the error code indicating that the request from the
master cannot be executed is added.
No response is returned for the hardware-detected error, frame error and CRC check error.
● Broadcast
By specifying address 0, the master can send a message to all slaves. All slaves that received
the message from the master execute the requested function. In this communication, the
slaves do not return a response to the master.
NOTE

FR-E700 EC

The inverter executes the function independently of the inverter station number setting
(Pr. 117) during broadcast communication.

Basically, the master sends a query message (question) and the slave returns a response message (response). When communication is normal, Device Address and Function Code are copied as they are, and when communication is abnormal (function code or data code is illegal), bit
7 (= 80h) of Function Code is turned on and the error code is set to Data Bytes.

Description

 Address field

The address code is 1 byte long (8 bits) and any of 0 to 247 can be set. Set "0" to send a
broadcast message (all-address instruction) or any of 1 to 247 to send a message to each
slave. When the slave responds, it returns the address set from the master. The value set to
Pr. 117 "PU communication station number" is the slave address.
The function code is 1 byte long (8 bits) and can be set to any of 1 to 255. The master sets the
function that it wants to request from the slave, and the slave performs the requested operation. The following table gives the supported function codes. An error response is returned if
the set function code is other than those in the following table. When the slave returns a normal response, it returns the function code set by the master. When the slave returns an error
response, it returns H80 + function code.

CRC check
field

The received message frame is checked for error. CRC check is performed, and 2 byte long
data is added to the end of the message. When CRC is added to the message, the low-order
byte is added first and is followed by the high-order byte. The CRC value is calculated by the
sending side that adds CRC to the message. The receiving side recalculates CRC during message receiving, and compares the result of that calculation and the actual value received in the
CRC check field. If these two values do not match, the result is defined as error.

Deviation value signal input
(LONWORKS, CC-Link communication)

Measured value, set point input
(LONWORKS, CC-Link communication)

If the proportional band is narrow (parameter setting is
small), the manipulated variable varies greatly with a
slight change of the measured value. Hence, as the
proportional band narrows, the response sensitivity
(gain) improves but the stability deteriorates, e.g. hunting occurs. Gain Kp= 1/proportional band

For deviation step input, time (Ti) required for only the
integral (I) action to provide the same manipulated variable as that for the proportional (P) action. As the integral time decreases, the set point is reached earlier but
hunting occurs more easily.

Calibration example

Example 쑴

A detector of 4mA at 0°C and 20mA at 50°C is used to adjust the room temperature to 25°C
under PID control. The set point is given to across inverter terminals 2-5 (0 to 5V).

Start

Determination of set point
Determine the set point of what is
desired to be adjusted.

Conversion of set point into %
Calculate the ratio of the set point to
the detector output.

Make calibration.

Setting of set point
Input a voltage across terminals 2-5
according to the set value %.

Operation
Set the proportional band (Pr. 129)
to a slightly larger value, the integral
time (Pr. 130) to a slightly longer
time, and the differential time
(Pr. 134) to "9999" (no function),
and turn on the start signal.

Set the room temperature to 25°C
Set Pr. 128 to "20" or "21" to enable PID control.

Detector specifications
When 0°C → 4mA and 50°C → 20mA are used, the set point
25°C is 50% on the assumption that 4mA is 0% and 20mA
is 100%.

Make the calibration as described in the following section
when the target setting input (0 to 5V) and detector output (4
to 20mA) must be calibrated.
When the set point is 50%
As the terminal 2 specifications are 0% → 0V and 100% → 5V,
input 2.5V to the terminal 2 for the set point of 50%.

When performing operation, first set the proportional band
(Pr. 129) to a slightly larger value, the integral time (Pr. 130)
to a slightly longer time, and the differential time (Pr. 134) to
"9999" (no function), and while looking at the system operation, decrease the proportional band (Pr. 129) and increase
the integral time (Pr. 130).

Yes
Is the set point stable?

No
Parameter adjustment
To stabilize the measured value,
change the proportional band
(Pr. 129) to a larger value, the
integral time (Pr. 130) to a slightly
longer time.

Parameter optimization
While the measured value is stable
throughout the operation status, the
proportional band (Pr. 129) an the integral time (Pr. 130) may be decreased.

Dancer control overview
Performs dancer control by setting 40 to 43 in Pr. 128 "PID action selection". The main speed
command is the speed command of each operation mode (external, PU, Network). Performs
PID control by the position detection signal of the dancer roller, then the result is added to the
main speed command. For acceleration/deceleration of the main speed, set the acceleration
time in Pr. 44 "Second acceleration/deceleration time" and the deceleration time in Pr. 45 "Second deceleration time".
Set 0s normally to Pr.7 "Acceleration time" and Pr.8 "Deceleration time". When the Pr. 7 and
Pr. 8 setting is large, response of dancer control during acceleration/deceleration is slow.

Special operation

NOTES

Parameter

In normal PID control, PID control is stopped when multi-speed operation signal (RH, RM,
RL, REX signal) or JOG signal is input. In dancer control, however, PID control continues
handling the signals as the main speed.
During dancer control, Second acceleration/deceleration time of Pr. 44 and Pr. 45 are the
parameters for acceleration/deceleration time setting to the main speed command source.
They do not function as the second function.
When switchover mode is set with "6" in Pr. 79 , dancer control (PID control) is invalid.
Speed command of terminal 4 input from terminal AU is invalid when dancer control is
selected.
Acceleration/deceleration of the main speed command is the same operation as when frequency command is increased/decreased by analog input.
 Therefore, SU signal remains on even if the starting signal is turned on/off (always in the
constant speed state).
 The DC brake operation starting frequency when turning off the starting signal is not Pr. 10
but a smaller value of either Pr. 13 or 0.5Hz.
 The set frequency monitor is always variable as "main speed command+PID control".
The main speed setting frequency accelerates for the acceleration/deceleration time set in
Pr. 44 and Pr. 45 and the output frequency accelerates/decelerates for the acceleration/
deceleration time set in Pr. 7 and Pr. 8. Therefore, when the set time of Pr. 7 and Pr. 8 is
longer than Pr. 44 and Pr. 45, the output frequency accelerates/decelerates for the acceleration/deceleration time set in Pr. 7 and Pr. 8.
For the integral term limit, a smaller value of either the PID manipulated variable (%) value
converted from the linear, interpolated Pr. 1 "Maximum frequency" with Pr. 902 and Pr. 903,
or 100% is used for limit. Although the output frequency is limited by the minimum frequency, operation limit of the integral term is not performed.

Special operation
What is regeneration avoidance function? (Pr. 882, Pr. 883)
When the regeneration status is serious, the DC bus voltage rises and an over voltage alarm
(E.OV) may occur. When this bus voltage rise is detected and the bus voltage level reaches
or exceeds Pr. 883, increasing the frequency avoids the regeneration status.
The regeneration avoidance function is always on when "1" is set in Pr. 882 and activated only
during a constant speed when "2" is set in Pr. 882.

Fig. 6-149: Regeneration avoidance function

NOTES

The inclination of the frequency increased or decreased by the regeneration avoidance function changes depending on the regeneration status.
The DC bus voltage of the inverter is normally about √2 times greater than the input voltage
(when the input voltage is 220 V, the bus voltage is about 311 V DC and when the input voltage is 440V AC, the bus voltage is about 622V DC). However, it varies with the input power
supply waveform.
The Pr. 883 setting should be kept higher than the DC bus voltage level. Otherwise, the
regeneration avoidance function is always on.
While over voltage stall (oL) stops the output frequency during deceleration, the regeneration avoidance function is always on and increases the frequency according to the regeneration amount.

Regeneration avoidance function adjustment (Pr. 665, Pr. 886)
If the frequency becomes instable during regeneration avoidance operation, decrease the setting of Pr. 886 "Regeneration avoidance voltage gain". Reversely, if sudden regeneration causes an overvoltage alarm, increase the setting.
When vibration is not suppressed by decreasing the Pr. 886 setting, set a smaller value in
Pr. 665 "Regeneration avoidance frequency gain".
NOTES

When regeneration avoidance operation is performed, "oL" (over voltage stall) is displayed
and the OL signal is output.
When regeneration avoidance operation is performed, stall prevention is also activated at
the same time.
The regeneration avoidance function cannot shorten the actual deceleration time taken to
stop the motor. The actual deceleration time depends on the regeneration energy consumption capability. When shortening the deceleration time, consider using the regeneration unit
(FR-BU2, FR-CV, FR-HC) and brake resistor (MRS, FR-ABR etc.) to consume regeneration
energy at constant speed.
When using the regeneration unit (FR-BU2, FR-CV, FR-HC) and brake resistor (FR-ABR
etc.), set Pr. 882 to "0 (initial value)" (regeneration avoidance function invalid). When using
the regeneration unit, etc. to consume regeneration energy at deceleration, set Pr. 882 to "2"
(regeneration avoidance function valid only at a constant speed).
When regeneration avoidance operation is performed, the OL signal output item of Pr. 156
also becomes the target of oL (over voltage stall). Pr. 157 "OL signal output timer" also
becomes the target of (over voltage stall).

Parameter

Useful functions
Turning the power on during measuring before LED of the operation panel turns off, it may remain in "measuring" (Pr. 259 = 2) status. In such case, carry out operation from step .

NOTE

P

For the accurate life measuring of the main circuit capacitor, perform after more than 3 hrs
passed since the turn off of the power as it is affected by the capacitor temperature.

WARNING:
When measuring the main circuit capacitor capacity (Pr. 259 "Main circuit capacitor
life measuring" = 1), the DC voltage is applied to the motor for 1s at powering off. Never
touch the motor terminal, etc. right after powering off to prevent an electric shock.

NOTES

When machine speed display is selected with Pr. 37, the minimum increments of the magnitude of change is determined by Pr.295 as well. Note that the setting value may differ as
speed setting changes the set machine speed and converts it to the speed dislay again.
When the set frequency (speed) is 100 or more, frequency is displayed in 0.1 increments.
Therefore, the minimum varying width is 0.1 even when Pr. 295 < 0.1.
When the machine speed setting is 1000 or more, frequency is displayed in 1 increments.
Therefore, the minimum varying width is 1 even when Pr. 295 < 1.

Troubleshooting
When an alarm occurs in the inverter, the protective function is activated bringing the inverter to
an alarm stop and the PU display automatically changes to any of the following error (alarm) indications. If your fault does not correspond to any of the following errors or if you have any other
problem, please contact your sales representative.
● Retention of fault output signal . . . . . . . . . . . When the magnetic contactor (MC) provided
on the input side of the inverter is opened at
the activation of the protective function, the
inverter’s control power will be lost and the
alarm output will not be held.
● Fault or alarm display . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . When the protective function is activated, the
operation panel display automatically switches to the above indication.
● Resetting method . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . When a protective function of the inverter is
activated, the power output of the inverter is
blocked (motor is coasting). The inverter cannot start up again unless an automatic restart
has been configured or the inverter is reset.
Please observe carefully the warnings contained below in the configuration of an automatic restart or the execution of a reset.
● If protective functions were activated (i. e. the inverter switched off with an error message)
follow the instructions for error correction provided in the manual for the inverter. Especially
in the case of short circuits or earth contacts in the inverter output and mains over voltages
the cause of the fault must be determined prior to switching on again as a recurrence of
such faults at short intervals can lead to premature aging of components or even the
complete breakdown of the device. After the cause of the fault has been found and corrected
the inverter can be reset and operations continue.

When installing meters etc. on the inverter output side
When the inverter-to-motor wiring length is large, especially in the 400V class, large-capacity

Meters and measuring methods

Measurement of powers
Using an electro-dynamometer type meter, measure the power in both the input and output
sides of the inverter using the two- or three-wattmeter method. As the current is liable to be imbalanced especially in the input side, it is recommended to use the three-wattmeter method.
Examples of measured value differences produced by different measuring meters are shown
below.
An error will be produced by difference between measuring instruments, e.g. power calculation
type and two- or three-wattmeter type three-phase wattmeter. When a CT is used in the current
measuring side or when the meter contains a PT on the voltage measurement side, an error will
also be produced due to the frequency characteristics of the CT and PT.
Measurement conditions:
Constant-torque (100%) load,
constant-output at 60Hz or more. 3.7kW, 4-pole motor,
value indicated in 3-wattmeter method is 100%

Troubleshooting

Measurement of voltages and use of PT
Inverter input side
As the input side voltage has a sine wave and it is extremely small in distortion, accurate measurement can be made with an ordinary AC meter.
Inverter output side
Since the output side voltage has a PWM-controlled rectangular wave, always use a rectifier
type voltmeter. A needle type tester can not be used to measure the output side voltage as it indicates a value much greater than the actual value. A moving-iron type meter indicates an effective value which includes harmonics and therefore the value is larger than that of the fundamental wave. The value monitored on the operation panel is the inverter-controlled voltage
itself. Hence, that value is accurate and it is recommended to monitor values (provide analog
output) using the operation panel.
PT
No PT can be used in the output side of the inverter. Use a direct-reading meter. (A PT can be
used in the input side of the inverter.)

7.7.3

Measurement of currents
Use a moving-iron type meter on both the input and output sides of the inverter. However, if the
carrier frequency exceeds 5kHz, do not use that meter since an overcurrent losses produced in
the internal metal parts of the meter will increase and themeter may burn out. In this case, use
an approximate-effective value type.
Since current on the inverter input side tends to be unbalanced, measurement of three phases
is recommended. Correct value can not be obtained by measuring only one or two phases. On
the other hand, the unbalanced ratio of each phase of the output side current should be within
10%.
When a clamp ammeter is used, always use an effective value detection type. A mean value detection type produces a large error and may indicate an extremely smaller value than the actual
value. The value monitored on the operation panel is accurateif the output frequency varies, and
it is recommended to monitor values (provide analog output) using the operation panel.
Examples of process value differences produced by different measuring meters are shown below.
Measurement conditions:
Value indicated by moving-iron type ammeter is 100%.

7.7.4

Meters and measuring methods

Use of CT and transducer
A CT may be used in both the input and output sides of the inverter, but the one used should
have the largest possible VA ability because an error will increase if the frequency gets lower.
When using a transducer, use the effective value calculation type which is immune to harmonics.

7.7.5

Measurement of inverter input power factor
Use the effective power and apparent power to calculate the inverter input power factor. A
power-factor meter cannot indicate an exact value.
Effective power
Total power factor of the inverter = -----------------------------------------Apparent power
3-phase input power found by 3-wattmeter method
= ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3 × V (power supply voltage) × I (input current effective value)

7.7.6

Measurement of converter output voltage (across terminals + and –)
The output voltage of the converter is developed across terminals + and – and can be measured
with a moving-coil type meter (tester). Although the voltage varies according to the power supply
voltage, approximately 270V DC to 300V DC (540V DC to 600V DC for the 400V class) is output
when no load is connected and voltage decreases during driving load operation.
When energy is regenerated from the motor during deceleration, for example, the converter output voltage rises to nearly 400V DC to 450V DC (800V DC to 900V DC for the 400V class) maximum. When this value is reached the alarm message E.OV is displayed and the inverter output is shut off.

Maintenance and inspection
The inverter is a static unit mainly consisting of semiconductor devices. Daily inspection must
be performed to prevent any fault from occurring due to the adverse effects of the operating environment, such as temperature, humidity, dust, dirt and vibration, changes in the parts with time, service life, and other factors.

P

WARNING:
Wait for a period of well over 10 minutes after disconnecting from the power supply
before performing any service work on the frequency inverter. This is necessary so
that the capacitors can discharge down to a safe level (< 25V) after disconnection of
the mains power. Check the voltage across the main circuit terminals + and – of the inverter
using a tester.

CAUTION:
Before measurement, check that the smoothing capacitor is discharged.

At the time of discontinuity, the measured value is almost 앝. When there is an instantaneous
continuity, due to the smoothing capacitor, the tester may not indicate 앝. At the time of continuity, the measured value is several to several ten’s-of ohms depending on the module type, circuit tester type, etc. If all measured values are almost thesame, the modules are without fault.

Smoothing capacitors
A large-capacity aluminum electrolytic capacitor is used for smoothing in the main circuit DC
section, and an aluminum electrolytic capacitor is used for stabilizing the control power in the
control circuit. Their characteristics are deteriorated by the adverse effects of ripple currents,
etc.
The replacement intervals greatly vary with the ambient temperature and operating conditions.
When the inverter is operated in air-conditioned, normal environment conditions, replace the capacitors about every 10 years
Judge that the capacitor has reached its life when the measured capacitance of the capacitor reduced below 80% of the rating.
When a certain period of time has elapsed, the capacitors will deteriorate more rapidly. Check
the capacitors at least every year (less than six months if the life will be expired soon).
The appearance criteria for inspection are as follows:
● Case: Check the side and bottom faces for expansion
● Sealing plate: Check for remarkable warp and extreme crack.
● Check for external crack, discoloration, fluid leakage, etc.

The applied motor capacity indicated is the maximum capacity applicable for use of the
Mitsubishi 4-pole standard motor.
The rated output capacity indicated assumes that the output voltage is 230V.
Setting 2kHz or more in Pr. 72 "PWM frequency selection" to perform low acoustic noise
operation with the ambient temperature exceeding 40°C, the rated output current is the value
in parentheses.
The % value of the overload current rating indicated is the ratio of the overload current to
the inverter’s rated output current. For repeated duty, allow time for the inverter and motor
to return to or below the temperatures under 100% load. If the automatic restart after
instantaneous power failure function (Pr. 57) or power failure stop function (Pr. 261) is set
and power supply voltage is low while load becomes bigger, the bus voltage decreases to
power failure detection level and load of 100% or more may not be available.
The maximum output voltage does not exceed the power supply voltage. The maximum
output voltage can be changed within the setting range. However, the pulse voltage value
of the inverter output side voltage remains unchanged at about 2 that of the power supply.
The power supply capacity varies with the value of the power supply side inverter impedance
(including those of the input reactor and cables).

The braking torque indicated is a short-duration average torque (which varies with motor
loss) when the motor alone is decelerated from 60Hz in the shortest time and is not a
continuous regenerative torque. When the motor is decelerated from the frequency higher
than the base frequency, the average deceleration torque will reduce. Since the inverter
does not contain a brake resistor, use the optional brake resistor when regenerative energy
is large. A brake unit (FR-BU2) may also be used.
This protective function is available with the three-phase power input specification model
only.
This protective function does not function in the initial status.
When using the inverters at the ambient temperature of 40°C or less, the inverters can be
installed closely attached (0cm clearance).
The product may only be exposed to the full extremes of this temperature range for short
periods (e.g. during transportation).
