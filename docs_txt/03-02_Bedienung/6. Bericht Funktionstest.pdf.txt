VESSEL PRESSURE TEST

   

TEST DESCRIPTION:
BEFORE STARTING TEST VERIFY THAT ALL THE OPENINGS ARE CLOSE

e Fill the unit with water up to the higher edge of the discharge nozzle.

e Pressurise the unit with air up to its DESIGN PRESSURE, allow a settling time of &', then
check the pressure gauge and adjust the pressure, if necessary..

e Start the agitator rotation at full speed.
e Hold the pressure for 1 hour, look for any leak of water from the sealing surfaces.

e Mark down on the Report:
- Rotation speed.
- Starting pressure reading and starting time.

- Pressure gauge reading after 1 hour.

ACCEPTABLE VALUES:
1. no visually detectable leaks from sealing surfaces

2. see the following pressure drop tables for maximum allowable leak rates.
